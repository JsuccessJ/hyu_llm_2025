    "input": "Clary Sage Eau de Parfum Intense is a fantastic journey outside and inside us: it is walking on an imaginary path that reconnects us to nature, offering a sweeping bird's-eye view of everything and simultaneously profound introspection within ourselves. It is a tribute to one’s ability to disengage from a physical place — such as a frenetic city like Milan — and the present.  It is knowing how to be on the \"Streets of Milan\" yet in an abstract ‘elsewhere’. To create this transcendental effect, perfumer Julie Massé harmonized a bouquet of essences with a woody scent known in ancient medicinal wisdom for their relaxing and invigorating power. Clary Sage Eau de Parfum Intense has a charismatic personality that takes advantage of the presence of an extraordinary millèsime  ingredient, the concrete of Blue Hemlock, a conifer with greenish-blue reflections and fresh, vigorous notes able to convey an extraordinary relaxing effect.\n\nClary Sage has a bright and energetic overture that comes from the semi-sweet, tart notes of grapefruit essential oil and those of Clary Sage [Salvia Sclarea], famous in phytotherapy for its healing, if not salvific, properties, as the Latin name infers. In perfumery it is loved for its fresh, spicy and herbaceous olfactory imprint. Furthermore, Sclareol is extracted through the steam distillation of Clary Sage leaves and flowers, whose aromatic and woody notes add depth and complexity to the fragrance and also help improve its persistence. In the heart notes, we find the millèsime ingredient, Blue Hemlock concrete, whose vibrant, aromatic notes instill a feeling of relaxation and a desire to merge with nature. The woody accord is completed by the fresh, spicy notes of Balsam Fir Absolute, which invite mental clarity, and the sweet and luminous notes of Myrtle. Finally, the essence of Patchouli with its magical and aphrodisiacal notes enriches the fragrance. To fix the bouquet, two synthetic molecules were used: Vegan Ambrettolide, a synthetic molecule with delicate musky notes that increases the persistence of the fragrance, and Orcanox™ — synthesized from Sclareol — replacing ambergris of animal origin with fixative properties and powdery, sensual notes.\nJulie Massé: “I wanted to create something unusual and provocative, strong enough to induce a dizzying sense of pleasure in which the unexpected note of Hemlock meets an enveloping note of Balsam Fir and a hypnotic note of Clary Sage.”\nTOP NOTES: Grapefruit Essential Oil, Clary Sage Essential Oil\nHEART NOTES: Myrtle Essential Oil, Hemlock Concrete, Balsam Fir Absolute                                 \nBASE NOTES: Vegan Ambrettolide, Patchouli Essential Oil, Orcanox ™\nOLFACTIVE FAMILY: Woody / Aromatic / Addictive",

A new chance is within reach.\n2002: CHANEL unveils CHANCE, a gleeful and optimistic floral fragrance creation. A name redolent of success and achievement. “Chance is a way of being”, said Gabrielle Chanel. It is no coincidence; it must be created, honed, sought out. It is the product of effort and passion. Four interpretations of this now-iconic scent emerged, including CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, a floral-sparkling fragrance with a modern, sophisticated, and decidedly light trail that features notes of jasmine and zesty citron paired with a teak wood accord. An invigorating composition with charming optimism.\n2023: CHANEL reinterprets CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, creating a version that combines the density of an Eau de Parfum with the brightness of the Eau de Toilette. For this unique composition, CHANEL Perfumer-Creator Olivier Polge amplified the intensity without overpowering its freshness—a challenge he met with great success. CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum has the same spontaneous, lively nature as the Eau de Toilette, but leaves behind a more intense trail. Rather than merely adjust the concentration, the perfumer composed something completely new, a fragrance in its own right. The citron accord has become exhilarating without losing its original juiciness; the jasmine is richer and more intense; and the teak wood accord reveals a more ambery facet, giving it a certain elegance.\nOLIVIER POLGE CHANEL IN-HOUSE PERFUMER-CREATOR\nWhat was the creative process behind CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum?\nIt involved making subtle changes in order to amplify the sensations provided by the Eau de Toilette. The idea was to go to extremes, to push the fresh notes even further, through citrus, and to add density with the base notes, ambery notes, for more vibration. The challenge with this was to increase its intensity, bring out the base notes, and add depth, all while maintaining its fresh quality.\nIs this Eau de Parfum a radical departure from the spirit of the Eau de Toilette?\nThey have the same fresh, colorful scent profile, with jasmine being the common thread that connects them. This new version is more textured and ambery than the Eau de Toilette. To achieve that, intensity has been brought to every layer of the composition (top, heart, base).\n\nHow would you describe the difference between CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette and Eau de Parfum?\nThe Eau de Parfum is a fresh, woody scent that opens with a burst of zest that is even more invigorating and exhilarating than before, accentuated by a hint of aldehydes. In this variation, the floral heart of jasmine is richer and adds a luminous, full-bodied quality. The teak wood accord and its intensified ambery notes add richness and depth for a more present trail.\nCHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum is available in sizes of 50ml and 100m starting August 2023.",
