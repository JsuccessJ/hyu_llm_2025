Being allowed to become an ambassador for the new Burberry fragrance feels particularly special and personal.\nTo me, lionesses represent female unity and strength. They are confident and move together. Much like them, we stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us and those who bolster us throughout our own lives. To me, this image is a real source of empowerment.” - Emma Mackey, Burberry Beauty Ambassador\nBurberry unveils the new Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, a unique aromatic fragrance for women. The launch is supported by a campaign featuring British-French actress and new ambassador for Burberry Beauty, Emma Mackey.\nThe campaign presents a story of self-discovery inspired by the collective strength and power of the pride of lionesses. Created with live footage of lionesses in their natural environment and the latest CGI technology, Burberry creates an imaginary world where Emma Mackey and the pride come together as one.\nEmbodying the spirit of the Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, Emma channels the strength of the pride, igniting the power within to discover her inner confidence and ascend the peak ahead of her. Echoing Shygirl in the overlaid vocals, ‘one of me, but I’m not the only one, we are many burning like the sun’, the lionesses represent the collective power of female strength and support and the fact that together, we can all discover our inner goddess and achieve the extraordinary.\nA unique gourmand aromatic fragrance led by a powerful trio of distinct vanillas. Collected by hand, the beans dry in the sun for five to seven weeks. They are then stored in wooden boxes to mature and develop their sweet signature aroma.\n“My initial goal for Burberry Goddess was to expand upon the common use of vanilla to deliver a new kind of rich olfactive experience. For this purpose, I used three distinct types of vanilla extraction. The first is a vanilla infusion, which provides the brightest, woody vanilla possible. Then I used Firgood™ , also known as vanilla caviar, for the first time in a fragrance. This innovative new ingredient adds a sweet, rich, and animalic vanilla. Lastly, vanilla absolute is darker and richer, enhancing the fragrance with a mysterious, milky aspect.\"  - Amandine Clerc-Marie, Master Perfumer.\nDuring the process of creating the perfect vanilla accord, the precious vanilla was wrapped with notes of bright Lavender Diva essence from Provence and earthy notes of cocoa and ginger roots, creating an aromatic balance to each vanilla.\nOlfactive Pyramid\nTop: Vanilla Infusion and Lavender\nHeart: Vanilla Caviar\nBase: Vanilla Absolute\nFamily: Gourmand Aromatic\nMarking Burberry’s first-ever refillable fragrance, the bottle boasts an elegant design.

A name redolent of success and achievement. “Chance is a way of being”, said Gabrielle Chanel. It is no coincidence; it must be created, honed, sought out. It is the product of effort and passion. Four interpretations of this now-iconic scent emerged, including CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, a floral-sparkling fragrance with a modern, sophisticated, and decidedly light trail that features notes of jasmine and zesty citron paired with a teak wood accord. An invigorating composition with charming optimism.\n2023: CHANEL reinterprets CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, creating a version that combines the density of an Eau de Parfum with the brightness of the Eau de Toilette. For this unique composition, CHANEL Perfumer-Creator Olivier Polge amplified the intensity without overpowering its freshness—a challenge he met with great success. CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum has the same spontaneous, lively nature as the Eau de Toilette, but leaves behind a more intense trail. Rather than merely adjust the concentration, the perfumer composed something completely new, a fragrance in its own right. The citron accord has become exhilarating without losing its original juiciness; the jasmine is richer and more intense; and the teak wood accord reveals a more ambery facet, giving it a certain elegance.\nOLIVIER POLGE CHANEL IN-HOUSE PERFUMER-CREATOR\nWhat was the creative process behind CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum?\nIt involved making subtle changes in order to amplify the sensations provided by the Eau de Toilette. The idea was to go to extremes, to push the fresh notes even further, through citrus, and to add density with the base notes, ambery notes, for more vibration. The challenge with this was to increase its intensity, bring out the base notes, and add depth, all while maintaining its fresh quality.\nIs this Eau de Parfum a radical departure from the spirit of the Eau de Toilette?\nThey have the same fresh, colorful scent profile, with jasmine being the common thread that connects them. This new version is more textured and ambery than the Eau de Toilette. To achieve that, intensity has been brought to every layer of the composition (top, heart, base).\n\nHow would you describe the difference between CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette and Eau de Parfum?\nThe Eau de Parfum is a fresh, woody scent that opens with a burst of zest that is even more invigorating and exhilarating than before, accentuated by a hint of aldehydes.

The original WŪLÓNG CHÁ has been celebrated mainly because of its robust power of refreshing notes.

Each petal pays tribute to all the facets of women.

Upstairs at Cafe Tabac was where Kate met Johnny, Madonna picked up the phone, Leo picked up supermodels. It was a place where the truly glamorous could be truly off-duty, an unselfconscious, pre-cell phone era that feels so far away as to be longed for again.\n“It’s the deep mood of a place to be, creating its own legend,” says perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour. “The deep blue smoke of cigarettes, cigars, weed … whatever. We’re exploring other paradises: laughs, desires, and pleasures, again and again.”\nThat spirit was also present when Duchaufour and Gerstner went to visit the Dominican Republic last year for another scented project. “It was an explosion of vibrant and chic people from Mexico, France, Rio, New York; different cultures and conversations and ideas and opinions,” says Gerstner. “We went from a tropical forest to the coast together, but it wasn’t until we were standing in a cigar factory that I looked at Bertrand and said, ‘Can you put this in a bottle?’”\nThe result is as dazzling, sexy, and complex as the trip: It opens with sparkling notes of expected (bergamot) and unexpected (apple, tamarind) fruits but the overall perfume is an homage to tobacco in many forms. Dry leaves, humid flowers, and a cigar lit by fire are represented thanks to herbal clary sage and davana, a tint of mango with dried fig and date, and a rough smokiness using tobacco absolute, tar, cade, and cedarwood. An amber accord of secretions and sugars from cistus and labdanum, ambergris, oakmoss, vanilla, cacao accord and Peru balm at the heart gives way to a darkly rich and resinous base. There is no saccharine here. Instead, distinctive burnt sugar and fresh clove and cardamom are infused with vapors that keep CAFE TABAC multilayered instead of perfectly round. It is blended at a twenty percent concentration made in the old school haute parfumerie style, including a month-long maceration in France.\nWith CAFE TABAC, there is a mad sensuality that feels like the olfactive equivalent of a twist of orange atop a demitasse of espresso—rich with a touch of freshness and tang.

It is a tribute to one’s ability to disengage from a physical place — such as a frenetic city like Milan — and the present.  It is knowing how to be on the \"Streets of Milan\" yet in an abstract ‘elsewhere’. To create this transcendental effect, perfumer Julie Massé harmonized a bouquet of essences with a woody scent known in ancient medicinal wisdom for their relaxing and invigorating power. Clary Sage Eau de Parfum Intense has a charismatic personality that takes advantage of the presence of an extraordinary millèsime  ingredient, the concrete of Blue Hemlock, a conifer with greenish-blue reflections and fresh, vigorous notes able to convey an extraordinary relaxing effect.\n\nClary Sage has a bright and energetic overture that comes from the semi-sweet, tart notes of grapefruit essential oil and those of Clary Sage [Salvia Sclarea], famous in phytotherapy for its healing, if not salvific, properties, as the Latin name infers. In perfumery it is loved for its fresh, spicy and herbaceous olfactory imprint. Furthermore, Sclareol is extracted through the steam distillation of Clary Sage leaves and flowers, whose aromatic and woody notes add depth and complexity to the fragrance and also help improve its persistence. In the heart notes, we find the millèsime ingredient, Blue Hemlock concrete, whose vibrant, aromatic notes instill a feeling of relaxation and a desire to merge with nature. The woody accord is completed by the fresh, spicy notes of Balsam Fir Absolute, which invite mental clarity, and the sweet and luminous notes of Myrtle. Finally, the essence of Patchouli with its magical and aphrodisiacal notes enriches the fragrance. To fix the bouquet, two synthetic molecules were used: Vegan Ambrettolide, a synthetic molecule with delicate musky notes that increases the persistence of the fragrance, and Orcanox™ — synthesized from Sclareol — replacing ambergris of animal origin with fixative properties and powdery, sensual notes.\nJulie Massé: “I wanted to create something unusual and provocative, strong enough to induce a dizzying sense of pleasure in which the unexpected note of Hemlock meets an enveloping note of Balsam Fir and a hypnotic note of Clary Sage.”\nTOP NOTES: Grapefruit Essential Oil, Clary Sage Essential Oil\nHEART NOTES: Myrtle Essential Oil, Hemlock Concrete, Balsam Fir Absolute                                 \nBASE NOTES: Vegan Ambrettolide, Patchouli Essential Oil, Orcanox ™\nOLFACTIVE FAMILY: Woody / Aromatic / Addictive",

Captivated by the star-studded sky, the Gucci alchemist dreams of a new olfactory Gucci fragrance honouring the brightest star from the Lion constellation - Gucci The Heart of Leo. Guided by his brightness, the lion leaps from the sky in search of the world’s most precious ingredients. Knowing that resinous incense brings opulence to those who possess it, the lion jumps to the Arabic peninsula where Olibanum grows. Here, the noble creature encounters the tears of weeping trees, the bark exuding an unexpected, spicy scent that warms his heart. A symphony of balsamic resin traverses continents through golden winds, beckoning the lion to return to his homeland, Africa. As he follows the scent to yet another tree, he encounters the balsamic nectar of myrrh and its liquorice smoky undertones that liberate his soul. To sweeten his journey back to the moon, the lion garlands his mane in a blood-red blackcurrant accord. With the promise of dawn nearing, harmony returns as the lion resumes his position in the sky. Happy with the lion’s fabled journey, the Gucci alchemist carefully encases the fruity, ambery elixir– and its night-sky-inspired story – in a black lacquered bottle. Much like the alchemist's ability to transform all that he touches into newfound wonders, this unisex Gucci fragrance is manufactured using alcohol made from 100% recycled carbon emissions.\nCapturing the spirit of nature and distilling it into exquisite elixirs, The Alchemist’s Garden collection is composed of customisable Gucci fragrances intended to be layered together.\nEach olfactory creation draws on a hero ingredient that changes and magnifies its character when worn with other Gucci scents.\nThe beauty of alchemy lies in the transformation: layered aromas that become new expressions of art and unfold the magic of unseen worlds.\nThe Gucci Heart of Leo unisex Gucci Eau de Parfum offers six recommended layering combinations, each designed to bring out the richness and opulence of its warm facets captured by its golden mane.\nCreate a warm incense with Gucci The Eyes of The Tiger.\nWhen applied with Gucci The Heart of Leo, the blend of Incense, Myrrh & Oriental captivates with its golden intensity.\nEnvision a floral tapestry woven with the opulent Damask Rose essence of Gucci A Reason to Love.\nIncense, Myrrh & Rose-infused Oud Accord summon sultry depths, revealing a gourmand and floral bouquet of aromas.|Add a touch of sweetness to the Myrrh with Gucci A Chant for the Nymph.\nInfuse floral undertones into Incense & Myrrh with the Frangipani accord to create a sweet incense.\nEnhance the Gucci fragrance’s rich character with Gucci A Forgotten Rose Perfumed Oil.\nA fresh Rose combined with Incense & Myrrh enriches the composition with its symphony of warm and fresh aromas.\nEnvelop yourself in the magic of the night with Gucci Moonlight Serenade Acqua Profumata.\nA Musky Lavender invigorates the ambery blend of Incense & Myrrh, infusing a sense of freshness into the composition.\nUnveil the richness of the ambery facets with Gucci A Forgotten Rose Perfumed Oil and Gucci Moonlight Serenade Acqua Profumata.\nRose & Lavender introduce floral hints to the Incense & Myrrh in this ambery aromatic olfactory creation.",

Much like the alchemist's ability to transform all that he touches into newfound wonders, this unisex Gucci fragrance is manufactured using alcohol made from 100% recycled carbon emissions.\nCapturing the spirit of nature and distilling it into exquisite elixirs, The Alchemist’s Garden collection is composed of customisable Gucci fragrances intended to be layered together.\nEach olfactory creation draws on a hero ingredient that changes and magnifies its character when worn with other Gucci scents.\nThe beauty of alchemy lies in the transformation: layered aromas that become new expressions of art and unfold the magic of unseen worlds.\nThe Gucci Heart of Leo unisex Gucci Eau de Parfum offers six recommended layering combinations, each designed to bring out the richness and opulence of its warm facets captured by its golden mane.\nCreate a warm incense with Gucci The Eyes of The Tiger.\nWhen applied with Gucci The Heart of Leo, the blend of Incense, Myrrh & Oriental captivates with its golden intensity.\nEnvision a floral tapestry woven with the opulent Damask Rose essence of Gucci A Reason to Love.\nIncense, Myrrh & Rose-infused Oud Accord summon sultry depths, revealing a gourmand and floral bouquet of aromas.|Add a touch of sweetness to the Myrrh with Gucci A Chant for the Nymph.\nInfuse floral undertones into Incense & Myrrh with the Frangipani accord to create a sweet incense.\nEnhance the Gucci fragrance’s rich character with Gucci A Forgotten Rose Perfumed Oil.\nA fresh Rose combined with Incense & Myrrh enriches the composition with its symphony of warm and fresh aromas.\nEnvelop yourself in the magic of the night with Gucci Moonlight Serenade Acqua Profumata.\nA Musky Lavender invigorates the ambery blend of Incense & Myrrh, infusing a sense of freshness into the composition.\nUnveil the richness of the ambery facets with Gucci A Forgotten Rose Perfumed Oil and Gucci Moonlight Serenade Acqua Profumata.\nRose & Lavender introduce floral hints to the Incense & Myrrh in this ambery aromatic olfactory creation.. Sentence B: The Heart of Leo by Gucci is a Oriental fragrance for women and men. This is a new fragrance. The Heart of Leo was launched in 2024.

Gods and Goddesses streak luminous resin fingerprints on sun-drenched saddles; thundering hooves softened with honey. Verdant grass tumbles and sears in August’s gilded sun. Colt strands stream in summer’s soft tempest. And you breathe again, with leather, heat, meadows and skin.\nOur Perfumer's Inspiration\n\"Epona embodies the cherished memories of Liz’s bond with her beloved horse amidst the enchanting English countryside. Inspired by their intimate connection, it captures the essence of warm summer days spent amidst sweet hay fields and the gentle caress of the sun. The fragrance intertwines notes of leather, opoponax, and violet to evoke the comforting scent of a cherished saddle and the earthy aroma of a horse's coat. With a subtle hint of saddle soap accord, it reminisces the tender care lavished upon a faithful companion. Epona is a nostalgic ode to the timeless bond between horse and rider amidst nature's embrace. Liz has placed her own leather accord and distinctive horse accord against honey, vetiver, oakmoass and petitgrain for a complex and stirring capturing of horse skin, hair, leather and meadows.\"",

Epona, a tribute to the Celtic goddess of horses, captures the essence of equine potency and pastoral tranquillity. The delicate floral touches of violet dance in ebbing sunbeams, while distinct saddle soap accord brings a vibrancy that springs forth from balmy hair. Gods and Goddesses streak luminous resin fingerprints on sun-drenched saddles; thundering hooves softened with honey. Verdant grass tumbles and sears in August’s gilded sun. Colt strands stream in summer’s soft tempest. And you breathe again, with leather, heat, meadows and skin.\nOur Perfumer's Inspiration\n\"Epona embodies the cherished memories of Liz’s bond with her beloved horse amidst the enchanting English countryside. Inspired by their intimate connection, it captures the essence of warm summer days spent amidst sweet hay fields and the gentle caress of the sun. The fragrance intertwines notes of leather, opoponax, and violet to evoke the comforting scent of a cherished saddle and the earthy aroma of a horse's coat. With a subtle hint of saddle soap accord, it reminisces the tender care lavished upon a faithful companion. Epona is a nostalgic ode to the timeless bond between horse and rider amidst nature's embrace. Liz has placed her own leather accord and distinctive horse accord against honey, vetiver, oakmoass and petitgrain for a complex and stirring capturing of horse skin, hair, leather and meadows.\". Sentence B: Epona by Papillon Artisan Perfumes is a fragrance for women and men. This is a new fragrance. Epona was launched in 2024..",
