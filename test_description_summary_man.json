The comet is a strong symbol for CHANEL, and I am thinking in particular of the Comète pendant from the 1932 high jewelry collection. \"When worn open and placed directly on the skin, it evokes the enveloping effect of a perfume on the skin\".\nWith intensely floral and luminous notes, COMÈTE explores a new olfactory identity in the LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL collection. Rich, elegant, and complex in nature, the Eau de Parfum is infused with the refreshing aroma of cherry blossoms, and this touch of brightness and purity transforms into a halo with notes of heliotrope blending with iris extract and musk harmony. This captivating fragrance, which envelops the skin in a mysterious charm, pays homage to its unique personality.\nCOMÈTE is a trail of stardust and a celestial jewel that chooses its own path and never deviates from it, reflecting Gabrielle Chanel. It is a halo of light, spreading a force of optimism for those who are convinced that the planets will align with their lucky star.\nMore unique and valuable than any other collection, the LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL collection is embodied in a bottle with excellent and simple design, focusing all attention on the fragrance. COMÈTE is packaged in a sleek and timeless glass bottle with a black cap signed with the brand's monogram. Its box brings simplicity to the level of luxury and sophistication, taking the form of an elegant white jewelry box with a black trim.\nResembling a heritage seal, this delicate two-tone aesthetic accompanies the launch of COMÈTE, a special limited edition: an embossed representation of the legendary Comète necklace, created in 1932, seductively embracing all four sides of the box. In a final tribute to the brilliance of diamonds and stardust, the Double C logo on top of the box is highlighted with silver ink.",

    "input": "Hexensalbe is a dark floral fragrance, rooted in the botanical underworld of witchcraft.\nHexensalbe, also known as witches’ flying ointment, was a hallucinogenic salve used in witchcraft in the middle ages. It was a mixture of extremely poisonous ingredients that produced an ecstatic trance with powerful sensations of flying, images of otherworldly creatures and a primal sexual hunger.\nThe ointment was so poisonous that eating it would be directly fatal, instead it was applied to other soft membranes of the body, armpits and more commonly the genitals. Because of the erotic effects of the high, the salve would often be rubbed directly onto a phallic object like the end of a staff or a broomstick. And so the popular image of witches riding on broomsticks has survived into our times, even if they rode them in a rather different sense. There are records from the 1200’s and forward where women have been found naked in a delirious trance, pleasuring themselves with the spicy devil’s dildo.",
