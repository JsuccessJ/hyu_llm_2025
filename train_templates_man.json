Anyone who got to know House of Merlo a little better quickly noticed our fascination with mysticism and everything mysterious. It will therefore come as no surprise that the result of this unique Polish-Italian cooperation is an incredibly enigmatic scent, thoroughly incense-like, completely enveloped in wisps of thick smoke.\nFrom the House of Merlo diary: “The dreamlike opening looms like a dreamy priest just after dusk, looking at the smoking elemi resin in which fragments of refreshing bergamot and lemon peel have congealed. The first aromas announcing the beginning of the ancient ritual quickly gain intensity when freshly ground pepper enters the censer, first a slightly more subtle, white variety, and then giving space to a much more wild and untamed black variety. The all-encompassing darkness encourages you to look towards the infinite universe, from the depths of which the ancient starlight illuminates the gray ribbons rising towards them, emerging from the glowing noble agarwood resin covered with damask rose petals, intricately combined with patchouli, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Just before dawn, when the night becomes darkest and everything around is pitch black, powerful, dark Frankish incense supports the ceremonial vigil. Arranged on cedar and sandalwood, wrapped in vanilla, sensual amber, and seductive musk, it recalls ancient times when man discovered fire and simultaneously experienced the extraordinary phenomenon of escaping smoke. Since the dawn of time, we have associated it with divinity, spirituality, and energy, and by observing it we believe that man is part of something bigger, not only the universe perceived through the senses. We are no longer surprised that in most parts of the world, the rite of incensation has become part of the most important ceremonies and rituals. The synergy of these completely spectacular essences brings scent-provoking metaphysical experiences, for all initiated hearts who have always \"see more\", but also for open minds who dare to break conventions and constantly look for answers hidden in the universe.\nTop note\nwhite pepper, elemi resin, lemon peel, bergamot\nHeart note\nblack pepper, patchouli, oud (agarwood), cinnamon, nutmeg, damask rose\nBase note\nincense, cedar tree, sandal tree, vanilla, ambergris, musk\n\nIncenso Notturno Extrait de Parfum is exlusive for House Of Merlo Perfumeria Niszova store, as 50ml Extrait de Parfum.",

    "input": "Rauque - the French word for “hoarse” - because like a somnolent voice, I answered with foggy scenes the silences of a daily life that prohibitions let out of breath. January 2021, in my Parisian flat the time was numb, the days uncertain to the point of losing touch with our senses and with the others because they meant danger; in that enclosure I brought spontaneity into play to create a diversion and belie my thoughts. From this introspection – sometimes feverish, sometimes exhilarating, “Rauque” was born: a series of photographs blending suspended compositions and captured portraits. A?er all, freedom is not asked for, it is searched for and seized like an antidote.\n\nWith a glass plate device that dissolves the contours of my subjects, I wanted to engage in a dialogue with absence and presence, indoor and outdoor. The obliteration of the object which, through the viewer's imagination, takes shape, stimulating peripheral awareness. A struggle then begins between the image and its disappearance\n\nThe image is a flat envelope, not enough for me to fully translate the essence of my allegories. So, since 2014, I've been incorporating an olfactory dimension into my photographic series. This allows the viewer to access sensory perceptions additional to those of sight. Thus, “Rauque – L’Objet parfumant” - “the perfuming object” - created in close collaboration with perfumer Christopher Sheldrake, comes to dress, or be dressed by, the photographic series.\n\n“Rauque – L’Objet parfumant” was born from my encounter with perfumer Christopher Sheldrake. We have elaborated the olfactive creation as I was working on my visual creation. Not forbidding ourselves anything, we wanted to be driven by artistic baldness, and if our alphabet was made up of words and images, it sometimes included music and taste as well. « I would like the smell of a body about to implode! » this is how our olfactory exchange started. The waxy basement of a mushroom farm, a doughy Alep soap, a sticky piece of leather left in the back of a stable, the muzzle of a cow, an old box of Japanese incense smelling of ancient and dust, flowers marked by the patina of time or forgotten fruits with carnal accents, we censored nothing to best convey the idea of a feverish body surrounded by sleepy lives. Odd ideas and risky materials abound, but Christopher’s mastery was the safeguard, nothing was to fear, everything would be enhanced.",

Distilled since the year 1000, its fragrant resin results from an attack on the Aquilaria wood, after a very slow process evolving over several decades. This sumptuous liquid gold, used here in overdose, then displays all its panache.\nWild floral, narcissus exalts the insolent character of Ruade with its mane note and its straw effects.

    "input": "I hope you will turn into an obsession,\nbecause you aid life.\nYou block false reality,\nacting in the shadows,\nerasing limits.\nThe twelfth fragrance in the monolithic UNUM collection is designed to confront the most heightened of emotions: fear. Almost as per tradition, the starting point inspiring it is an extract from the Gospel of Matthew, the parable of the ten virgins. The story – which also gives the fragrance its name – is that of ten women who prudently save oil so they can burn their lamps as they await the bridegroom’s arrival. We know that of the ten, only five – described as very wise - participate in the wedding party; the others, having gone to find more oil for their lamps, find the door closed to them. “Lord, open to us”, they say upon arriving, receiving the response: “Truly I say to you: I do not know you”. We also know that, while they were awaiting the groom’s arrival, they too fell asleep, but were ready to wake up and rejoice: \"stay awake, therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour\", we read in Matthew.\nThis is just the start. The idea is to go beyond the evangelism of these words and face our fears on a deeper, more intense level, evoking conflicting emotions and experiencing the seductive charm of danger – an \"amor fati\" as Nietzsche claimed – or at least, the presence of things beyond our control. This is a characteristic feature of horror literature (and more); it’s the power of the uncontrolled over us. Yet the existence of fear always requires something else: not lack of courage, but the presence of what we most desire. What remains most men’s highest aspiration is also a harbinger of trouble: freedom.\nThe perfume conveys the idea of destruction, the choice to be silent, and the introspection needed to delve into the depths of the skin’s most remote existence.\nYet seeking to control it stirs attraction and even feelings of pleasure towards that sought-after, desired fear.\nMan is caught in a horrific fate, and our society, with the violent approval of the mob, tries to daze itself and deny the truth, or rather Being-for-death.\nOnly in this way does man become I in his darkest, unspoken shadow, displaying his true nature made up of contradictions and desires. Faced with fear, seemingly chaotic primordial needs composed of dormant, hidden, and dangerous eroticism are triggered, making the impossible possible.\nThe packaging is in line with the UNUM collection; this time it is sealed with a cold transparent film and a silver label. The bottle (also silver) is placed in a \"silent\" black velvet bag, sealed in a heat-shrunk sheath which needs to be cut physically using the metal scissors contained in the box.\nFollowing his religious fall into the realm of dust, faced with life on a fragile planet, and having lost all his bearings, man is inextricably connected to fear, forced to wander in the dark side of the soul. Inside that room, he perceives a dim light that reveals deformed limbs sharing monstrous things that seek to destroy respectability and take pleasure in suffocating souls, no longer reckoning with life’s balance sheets but with a form of salvation that’s ever more distant.",

    "input": "Following the remarkable success of Arabians Tonka, Montale proudly unveils the next addition to its Arabians collection: Arabians Musk. This fragrance, while staying true to the captivating magic of the Orient, highlights the sensual and mysterious essence of musk. As with Montale’s previous creations, Arabians Musk is more than just a scent; it is a journey through the Moroccan desert, where each moment offers as much enchantment as the final destination.\nThe Fragrance Notes:\nArabians Musk is a sophisticated composition that artfully blends rare and luxurious ingredients, creating a fragrance experience that is both powerful and delicate. The journey begins with the golden sweetness of Sweet Honey, capturing the warmth of the day, while Bergamot Zests add a fresh, citrusy burst that awakens the senses. The richness of Tasty Medjool Dates evokes the caramelized scent of sun-drenched dates, grounding the fragrance in an opulent warmth.\nA delicate floral breeze comes through with Tunisian Orange Flower, inspired by the blossoms found in a Moroccan oasis, adding a touch of lightness and elegance. The comforting sweetness of Vanilla Sugar follows, evoking a sense of indulgence. Venezuelan Tonka Beans bring a balsamic richness to the composition, enhancing its depth and sophistication. At the heart of the fragrance lies Warm Musk—sensual, enveloping, and unforgettable—tying together the luxurious notes and leaving a lasting impression.\nArabians Musk transports you to a summer evening on a winding road through the Atlas Mountains, leading toward the vast Sahara desert. The air is tinged with the familiar, glycerine-like scent of leather care products, evoking memories of horse-riding gear from a nearby stable. At the foot of the Atlas lies a stable owned by a dear friend, where the legendary horse CALAFETE, a stunning figure known worldwide from Montale’s Arabians Tonka campaign, is cared for. As daylight fades and the mystical blue hour sets in, you stop in front of an endless palm grove. The scattered dates on the ground, nearly caramelized under the day’s scorching sun, release a deep, intoxicating aroma. Nearby, an oasis emerges, surrounded by orange blossoms, their delicate fragrance filling the twilight air. This journey, much like the fragrance itself, serves as a metaphor: sometimes, the destination is less important than the path taken, where every moment becomes a source of joy and wonder.\nThe bottle of Arabians Musk is an elegant work of art, offering a striking contrast to the deep-toned bottle of Arabians Tonka. This new release is encased in a soft lacquered brown, reminiscent of the smooth sweetness of ripe dates and the delicate white flowers found in Moroccan oases. This lighter hue reflects a balance between strength and softness, subtly connecting the robustness of horse-riding leather gear to the fragrance’s delicate sensuality. The bottle’s soft, glycerine-like finish mirrors the tactile smoothness of leather cared for with fine oils, a nod to the noble equestrian world. This smooth texture, combined with the warm, luminous brown, evokes both the sweetness of dates and the light floral notes of orange blossom, creating an object that is as sensual to the touch as the fragrance is to the senses.\nArabians Musk is not merely a fragrance; it is an invitation to a sensory journey, where each olfactory note is a new step on the path to discovery. Inspired by magical Moroccan nights and the world of noble horses, this fragrance is a captivating blend of musky sensuality and floral, sugary notes, offering a deeply luxurious and evocative experience. The bottle, with its soft lacquered brown hue, perfectly encapsulates the contrast between the rugged nobility of purebred horses and the delicate sweetness of the scent. Arabians Musk celebrates freedom, sensuality, and elegance, reminding us that the beauty of the journey is as much in the moments along the way as in the final destination.",

    "input": "THE FRAGRANCE OF A NEW DAWN\nObsidian, coal, earth, rocks, crystals, the stormy sea, and the fiery dawn on a volcanic island. Emerging from the core of the earth is a primitive and powerful treasure: Trussardi Primo. A tribute to resilient masculinity, it is powerful, explosive and simultaneously the precursor of a new olfactory saga. It is the dawn of a new day, full of promise. The man imagined by the Trussardi maison is intrepid and confident in the future, a pioneer in a new world. Trussardi Primo rewrites the codes of men's perfumery starting from the courageous and innovative olfactory pyramid to the packaging, a work of art with a green heart. The composition is like a flower warmed by the first rays at dawn: it opens slowly and celebrates the daily miracle of rebirth with its fragrance. Its bold, virile notes evoke the freshness of the sea air mixed with the heat of volcanic lava, creating a unique olfactory harmony that reflects the duality of the island itself: the untamed\npower of nature and the beauty of its landscape. Wearing Trussardi Primo is like wrapping yourself in a cloak of courage and confidence, ready to face any obstacle. Trussardi Primo is the invitation to embrace the light of day with primitive, powerful energy. It is the exhortation to discover your inner strength and potential.\nTrussardi Primo is an unexpected fougère with a persistent sillage and \"noir” nuances obtained from an accord of bergamot, geranium, musk, lavender, vetiver, and tonka beans. The liquid contains organic ingredients from Italy, extracted with highly technological processes that respect the characteristics of the raw material in order to capture every olfactory nuance. Here is how perfumer Violaine Collas describes it: \"The last time I was in Sicily was immediately after an eruption of Mount Etna. It was a truly inspiring scene that compelled me to recreate a similar sensation: the sensation of heat, like that of an eruption of incandescent lava. This image gave me the idea of using a maple syrup accord, super addictive with its golden nuances. I also wanted a dash of pepper to convey a sensation of danger and restore the hypnotic beauty of the volcano, intertwined with a dark, mineral black lava accord. Thus, a warm and sexy fragrance was born.\"\nTHE BOTTLE AND PACKAGING\nAt the center of a volcanic island, shrouded in the mists of dawn and surrounded by a tumultuous sea, stands a totem-like bottle, a work of art in glass with iridescent nuances that start from black, so typical of the night, and veer towards a shade of red that tinges the early hours of a new day. Like a reflection of dawn that slowly rises on the horizon, the bottle mesmerizes with its chromatic metamorphosis, conveying the promise of a bold, new beginning.\nThe glass bottle, substantial in weight and compact to the touch, transmits a sensation of power and solidity as a tangible sign of the wearer's inner determination. Like lava that runs down the sides of the volcano and carves out the landscape, the glass is transformed into an elegant and sculptural swirl that captures the essence of primordial fire. The design of Trussardi Primo is a revolution in packaging for perfumery, thanks to a few elements like the threading under the dispenser and the reusable magnetic cap. Solid, refined and refillable, the bottle combines high-level ecological green solutions without compromising its aesthetics. All components are non-toxic, recyclable or reusable. Likewise, the refill bottle follows the same ethics and aesthetics. The Trussardi Primo box is made of recyclable materials like FSC paper from forests managed according to rigorous environmental and social criteria. It echoes the same colors of the bottle with gradient shades passing from black to red and features embossed lettering with a vinyl finish.\n\"I'm excited by novelty. I believe that people who seek new things are unwilling to repeat what they've seen\nbefore...” Fabien Baron.\nFor over three decades culminating in illustrious accolades and awards, Fabien Baron has dominated the industrial design landscape with a proactive mind and unparalleled creativity, defining the success of some of the most prominent global brands. His boundless artistic conception unfolds through myriad facets, drawing from art to nature. During his career, Baron was the catalyst for the revival of famous magazines and brands, and he also created his own furniture line. Baron embodies the immense fervor that only true masters possess, shaping ideas and projects and making them a reality. For Trussardi Primo, he curated the design of the bottle and packaging, paying great attention not only to the aesthetic aspects of the latter, but also to its environmental impact.\nADVERTISING CAMPAIGN – THE CONCEPT\nAn epic, nocturnal escape in search of oneself in the volcanic landscape of Lanzarote, the lava island. Dark rocks and wild nature, majestic and exciting, are the backdrop of this primitive night. The mystery of nature demands respect, contemplation, and total dedication. The senses expand between the images, visions, smells, and sounds of a captivating and evocative night. It inebriates and confounds, but also sends signals that transform into symbols for the protagonist's journey guided by the stars and the light of the imminent dawn. The shadow of a man accompanied by his noble greyhound merges with the landscape in a deep connection with the surrounding natural elements.",

Captivated by the star-studded sky, the Gucci alchemist dreams of a new olfactory Gucci fragrance honouring the brightest star from the Lion constellation - Gucci The Heart of Leo. Guided by his brightness, the lion leaps from the sky in search of the world’s most precious ingredients. Knowing that resinous incense brings opulence to those who possess it, the lion jumps to the Arabic peninsula where Olibanum grows. Here, the noble creature encounters the tears of weeping trees, the bark exuding an unexpected, spicy scent that warms his heart. A symphony of balsamic resin traverses continents through golden winds, beckoning the lion to return to his homeland, Africa. As he follows the scent to yet another tree, he encounters the balsamic nectar of myrrh and its liquorice smoky undertones that liberate his soul. To sweeten his journey back to the moon, the lion garlands his mane in a blood-red blackcurrant accord. With the promise of dawn nearing, harmony returns as the lion resumes his position in the sky. Happy with the lion’s fabled journey, the Gucci alchemist carefully encases the fruity, ambery elixir– and its night-sky-inspired story – in a black lacquered bottle. Much like the alchemist's ability to transform all that he touches into newfound wonders, this unisex Gucci fragrance is manufactured using alcohol made from 100% recycled carbon emissions.\nCapturing the spirit of nature and distilling it into exquisite elixirs, The Alchemist’s Garden collection is composed of customisable Gucci fragrances intended to be layered together.\nEach olfactory creation draws on a hero ingredient that changes and magnifies its character when worn with other Gucci scents.\nThe beauty of alchemy lies in the transformation: layered aromas that become new expressions of art and unfold the magic of unseen worlds.\nThe Gucci Heart of Leo unisex Gucci Eau de Parfum offers six recommended layering combinations, each designed to bring out the richness and opulence of its warm facets captured by its golden mane.\nCreate a warm incense with Gucci The Eyes of The Tiger.\nWhen applied with Gucci The Heart of Leo, the blend of Incense, Myrrh & Oriental captivates with its golden intensity.\nEnvision a floral tapestry woven with the opulent Damask Rose essence of Gucci A Reason to Love.\nIncense, Myrrh & Rose-infused Oud Accord summon sultry depths, revealing a gourmand and floral bouquet of aromas.|Add a touch of sweetness to the Myrrh with Gucci A Chant for the Nymph.\nInfuse floral undertones into Incense & Myrrh with the Frangipani accord to create a sweet incense.\nEnhance the Gucci fragrance’s rich character with Gucci A Forgotten Rose Perfumed Oil.\nA fresh Rose combined with Incense & Myrrh enriches the composition with its symphony of warm and fresh aromas.\nEnvelop yourself in the magic of the night with Gucci Moonlight Serenade Acqua Profumata.\nA Musky Lavender invigorates the ambery blend of Incense & Myrrh, infusing a sense of freshness into the composition.\nUnveil the richness of the ambery facets with Gucci A Forgotten Rose Perfumed Oil and Gucci Moonlight Serenade Acqua Profumata.\nRose & Lavender introduce floral hints to the Incense & Myrrh in this ambery aromatic olfactory creation.",

Smoke meets flower and spice settles in for the next inhale. This is CAFÉ TABAC.\nBefore Aedes de Venustas’s newest scent was realized in a bottle, it had a name: CAFÉ TABAC, inspired by the iconic 90s bar in the East Village. Upstairs at Cafe Tabac was where Kate met Johnny, Madonna picked up the phone, Leo picked up supermodels. It was a place where the truly glamorous could be truly off-duty, an unselfconscious, pre-cell phone era that feels so far away as to be longed for again.\n“It’s the deep mood of a place to be, creating its own legend,” says perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour. “The deep blue smoke of cigarettes, cigars, weed … whatever. We’re exploring other paradises: laughs, desires, and pleasures, again and again.”\nThat spirit was also present when Duchaufour and Gerstner went to visit the Dominican Republic last year for another scented project. “It was an explosion of vibrant and chic people from Mexico, France, Rio, New York; different cultures and conversations and ideas and opinions,” says Gerstner. “We went from a tropical forest to the coast together, but it wasn’t until we were standing in a cigar factory that I looked at Bertrand and said, ‘Can you put this in a bottle?’”\nThe result is as dazzling, sexy, and complex as the trip: It opens with sparkling notes of expected (bergamot) and unexpected (apple, tamarind) fruits but the overall perfume is an homage to tobacco in many forms. Dry leaves, humid flowers, and a cigar lit by fire are represented thanks to herbal clary sage and davana, a tint of mango with dried fig and date, and a rough smokiness using tobacco absolute, tar, cade, and cedarwood. An amber accord of secretions and sugars from cistus and labdanum, ambergris, oakmoss, vanilla, cacao accord and Peru balm at the heart gives way to a darkly rich and resinous base. There is no saccharine here. Instead, distinctive burnt sugar and fresh clove and cardamom are infused with vapors that keep CAFE TABAC multilayered instead of perfectly round. It is blended at a twenty percent concentration made in the old school haute parfumerie style, including a month-long maceration in France.\nWith CAFE TABAC, there is a mad sensuality that feels like the olfactive equivalent of a twist of orange atop a demitasse of espresso—rich with a touch of freshness and tang. To wear it is to maintain a state of heightened emotions that are sooner remembered than they are recorded.",

Star jasmine has a distinct appearance resembling a \"pinwheel\" and takes center stage on the front of the BLOOM box. Unlike other jasmines, it has a sweeter scent and lacks the typical indolic or animalic notes.\nTogether, these four jasmine oils create a harmonious fusion of scents, inviting the wearer on a captivating olfactory voyage through the lush gardens of the imagination.\n\"Zaharoff Signature BLOOM, a jasmine incense, opening with the heady embrace of jasmine, its intoxicating aroma filling the air like a floral symphony. Each spray carries with it the essence of a thousand whispered secrets, a thousand forgotten dreams, as if the very soul of the collective world itself were captured within its petals.\nAs the scent unfolds, it reveals a heart of sacred resins - myrrh and frankincense mingling with the warm embrace of oud, their smoky tendrils weaving a tapestry of ancient wisdom and divine mystery. It is as if the fragrance itself is a portal to another world, a gateway to the realms of the gods.\nFor within its depths lies the promise of renewal, of new beginnings and endless possibilities. For in the heart of BLOOM, where jasmine and resin intertwine, lies the key to unlocking the mysteries of the universe - a fragrance so powerful, so intoxicating, that it has the power to change the course of destiny itself.\"",

    "input": "Sentence A: THE FRAGRANCE OF A NEW DAWN\nObsidian, coal, earth, rocks, crystals, the stormy sea, and the fiery dawn on a volcanic island. Emerging from the core of the earth is a primitive and powerful treasure: Trussardi Primo. A tribute to resilient masculinity, it is powerful, explosive and simultaneously the precursor of a new olfactory saga. It is the dawn of a new day, full of promise. The man imagined by the Trussardi maison is intrepid and confident in the future, a pioneer in a new world. Trussardi Primo rewrites the codes of men's perfumery starting from the courageous and innovative olfactory pyramid to the packaging, a work of art with a green heart. The composition is like a flower warmed by the first rays at dawn: it opens slowly and celebrates the daily miracle of rebirth with its fragrance. Its bold, virile notes evoke the freshness of the sea air mixed with the heat of volcanic lava, creating a unique olfactory harmony that reflects the duality of the island itself: the untamed\npower of nature and the beauty of its landscape. Wearing Trussardi Primo is like wrapping yourself in a cloak of courage and confidence, ready to face any obstacle. Trussardi Primo is the invitation to embrace the light of day with primitive, powerful energy. It is the exhortation to discover your inner strength and potential.\nTrussardi Primo is an unexpected fougère with a persistent sillage and \"noir” nuances obtained from an accord of bergamot, geranium, musk, lavender, vetiver, and tonka beans. The liquid contains organic ingredients from Italy, extracted with highly technological processes that respect the characteristics of the raw material in order to capture every olfactory nuance. Here is how perfumer Violaine Collas describes it: \"The last time I was in Sicily was immediately after an eruption of Mount Etna. It was a truly inspiring scene that compelled me to recreate a similar sensation: the sensation of heat, like that of an eruption of incandescent lava. This image gave me the idea of using a maple syrup accord, super addictive with its golden nuances. I also wanted a dash of pepper to convey a sensation of danger and restore the hypnotic beauty of the volcano, intertwined with a dark, mineral black lava accord. Thus, a warm and sexy fragrance was born.\"\nTHE BOTTLE AND PACKAGING\nAt the center of a volcanic island, shrouded in the mists of dawn and surrounded by a tumultuous sea, stands a totem-like bottle, a work of art in glass with iridescent nuances that start from black, so typical of the night, and veer towards a shade of red that tinges the early hours of a new day. Like a reflection of dawn that slowly rises on the horizon, the bottle mesmerizes with its chromatic metamorphosis, conveying the promise of a bold, new beginning.\nThe glass bottle, substantial in weight and compact to the touch, transmits a sensation of power and solidity as a tangible sign of the wearer's inner determination. Like lava that runs down the sides of the volcano and carves out the landscape, the glass is transformed into an elegant and sculptural swirl that captures the essence of primordial fire. The design of Trussardi Primo is a revolution in packaging for perfumery, thanks to a few elements like the threading under the dispenser and the reusable magnetic cap. Solid, refined and refillable, the bottle combines high-level ecological green solutions without compromising its aesthetics. All components are non-toxic, recyclable or reusable. Likewise, the refill bottle follows the same ethics and aesthetics. The Trussardi Primo box is made of recyclable materials like FSC paper from forests managed according to rigorous environmental and social criteria. It echoes the same colors of the bottle with gradient shades passing from black to red and features embossed lettering with a vinyl finish.\n\"I'm excited by novelty. I believe that people who seek new things are unwilling to repeat what they've seen\nbefore...” Fabien Baron.\nFor over three decades culminating in illustrious accolades and awards, Fabien Baron has dominated the industrial design landscape with a proactive mind and unparalleled creativity, defining the success of some of the most prominent global brands. His boundless artistic conception unfolds through myriad facets, drawing from art to nature. During his career, Baron was the catalyst for the revival of famous magazines and brands, and he also created his own furniture line. Baron embodies the immense fervor that only true masters possess, shaping ideas and projects and making them a reality. For Trussardi Primo, he curated the design of the bottle and packaging, paying great attention not only to the aesthetic aspects of the latter, but also to its environmental impact.\nADVERTISING CAMPAIGN – THE CONCEPT\nAn epic, nocturnal escape in search of oneself in the volcanic landscape of Lanzarote, the lava island. Dark rocks and wild nature, majestic and exciting, are the backdrop of this primitive night. The mystery of nature demands respect, contemplation, and total dedication. The senses expand between the images, visions, smells, and sounds of a captivating and evocative night. It inebriates and confounds, but also sends signals that transform into symbols for the protagonist's journey guided by the stars and the light of the imminent dawn. The shadow of a man accompanied by his noble greyhound merges with the landscape in a deep connection with the surrounding natural elements..

Endless dinners and all-night merengue dancing under charcoal skies. Smoke meets flower and spice settles in for the next inhale. This is CAFÉ TABAC.\nBefore Aedes de Venustas’s newest scent was realized in a bottle, it had a name: CAFÉ TABAC, inspired by the iconic 90s bar in the East Village. Upstairs at Cafe Tabac was where Kate met Johnny, Madonna picked up the phone, Leo picked up supermodels. It was a place where the truly glamorous could be truly off-duty, an unselfconscious, pre-cell phone era that feels so far away as to be longed for again.\n“It’s the deep mood of a place to be, creating its own legend,” says perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour. “The deep blue smoke of cigarettes, cigars, weed … whatever. We’re exploring other paradises: laughs, desires, and pleasures, again and again.”\nThat spirit was also present when Duchaufour and Gerstner went to visit the Dominican Republic last year for another scented project. “It was an explosion of vibrant and chic people from Mexico, France, Rio, New York; different cultures and conversations and ideas and opinions,” says Gerstner. “We went from a tropical forest to the coast together, but it wasn’t until we were standing in a cigar factory that I looked at Bertrand and said, ‘Can you put this in a bottle?’”\nThe result is as dazzling, sexy, and complex as the trip: It opens with sparkling notes of expected (bergamot) and unexpected (apple, tamarind) fruits but the overall perfume is an homage to tobacco in many forms. Dry leaves, humid flowers, and a cigar lit by fire are represented thanks to herbal clary sage and davana, a tint of mango with dried fig and date, and a rough smokiness using tobacco absolute, tar, cade, and cedarwood. An amber accord of secretions and sugars from cistus and labdanum, ambergris, oakmoss, vanilla, cacao accord and Peru balm at the heart gives way to a darkly rich and resinous base. There is no saccharine here. Instead, distinctive burnt sugar and fresh clove and cardamom are infused with vapors that keep CAFE TABAC multilayered instead of perfectly round. It is blended at a twenty percent concentration made in the old school haute parfumerie style, including a month-long maceration in France.\nWith CAFE TABAC, there is a mad sensuality that feels like the olfactive equivalent of a twist of orange atop a demitasse of espresso—rich with a touch of freshness and tang. To wear it is to maintain a state of heightened emotions that are sooner remembered than they are recorded.. Sentence B: Café Tabac by Aedes de Venustas is a Aromatic fragrance for women and men.

Ultimately evolution would betray them, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort.\nIn Zoologist Dodo, notes of jackfruit and bergamot border a winding path dappled with aromatic turmeric and pink pepper. Venture along it to the heart of an island forest where hints of powdery orris emerge from beneath a potpourri of lavender, geranium, and orange flower. Soothed by the comforting florals, you’ll soon surrender, sinking into the loam where woody tonka and sandalwood sprout from an earthy base of patchouli and vetiver..

    "input": "Sentence A: I hope you will turn into an obsession,\nbecause you aid life.\nYou block false reality,\nacting in the shadows,\nerasing limits.\nThe twelfth fragrance in the monolithic UNUM collection is designed to confront the most heightened of emotions: fear. Almost as per tradition, the starting point inspiring it is an extract from the Gospel of Matthew, the parable of the ten virgins. The story – which also gives the fragrance its name – is that of ten women who prudently save oil so they can burn their lamps as they await the bridegroom’s arrival. We know that of the ten, only five – described as very wise - participate in the wedding party; the others, having gone to find more oil for their lamps, find the door closed to them. “Lord, open to us”, they say upon arriving, receiving the response: “Truly I say to you: I do not know you”. We also know that, while they were awaiting the groom’s arrival, they too fell asleep, but were ready to wake up and rejoice: \"stay awake, therefore, because you know neither the day nor the hour\", we read in Matthew.\nThis is just the start. The idea is to go beyond the evangelism of these words and face our fears on a deeper, more intense level, evoking conflicting emotions and experiencing the seductive charm of danger – an \"amor fati\" as Nietzsche claimed – or at least, the presence of things beyond our control. This is a characteristic feature of horror literature (and more); it’s the power of the uncontrolled over us. Yet the existence of fear always requires something else: not lack of courage, but the presence of what we most desire. What remains most men’s highest aspiration is also a harbinger of trouble: freedom.\nThe perfume conveys the idea of destruction, the choice to be silent, and the introspection needed to delve into the depths of the skin’s most remote existence.\nYet seeking to control it stirs attraction and even feelings of pleasure towards that sought-after, desired fear.\nMan is caught in a horrific fate, and our society, with the violent approval of the mob, tries to daze itself and deny the truth, or rather Being-for-death.\nOnly in this way does man become I in his darkest, unspoken shadow, displaying his true nature made up of contradictions and desires. Faced with fear, seemingly chaotic primordial needs composed of dormant, hidden, and dangerous eroticism are triggered, making the impossible possible.\nThe packaging is in line with the UNUM collection; this time it is sealed with a cold transparent film and a silver label. The bottle (also silver) is placed in a \"silent\" black velvet bag, sealed in a heat-shrunk sheath which needs to be cut physically using the metal scissors contained in the box.\nFollowing his religious fall into the realm of dust, faced with life on a fragile planet, and having lost all his bearings, man is inextricably connected to fear, forced to wander in the dark side of the soul. Inside that room, he perceives a dim light that reveals deformed limbs sharing monstrous things that seek to destroy respectability and take pleasure in suffocating souls, no longer reckoning with life’s balance sheets but with a form of salvation that’s ever more distant..

This fragrance, while staying true to the captivating magic of the Orient, highlights the sensual and mysterious essence of musk. As with Montale’s previous creations, Arabians Musk is more than just a scent; it is a journey through the Moroccan desert, where each moment offers as much enchantment as the final destination.\nThe Fragrance Notes:\nArabians Musk is a sophisticated composition that artfully blends rare and luxurious ingredients, creating a fragrance experience that is both powerful and delicate. The journey begins with the golden sweetness of Sweet Honey, capturing the warmth of the day, while Bergamot Zests add a fresh, citrusy burst that awakens the senses. The richness of Tasty Medjool Dates evokes the caramelized scent of sun-drenched dates, grounding the fragrance in an opulent warmth.\nA delicate floral breeze comes through with Tunisian Orange Flower, inspired by the blossoms found in a Moroccan oasis, adding a touch of lightness and elegance. The comforting sweetness of Vanilla Sugar follows, evoking a sense of indulgence. Venezuelan Tonka Beans bring a balsamic richness to the composition, enhancing its depth and sophistication. At the heart of the fragrance lies Warm Musk—sensual, enveloping, and unforgettable—tying together the luxurious notes and leaving a lasting impression.\nArabians Musk transports you to a summer evening on a winding road through the Atlas Mountains, leading toward the vast Sahara desert. The air is tinged with the familiar, glycerine-like scent of leather care products, evoking memories of horse-riding gear from a nearby stable. At the foot of the Atlas lies a stable owned by a dear friend, where the legendary horse CALAFETE, a stunning figure known worldwide from Montale’s Arabians Tonka campaign, is cared for. As daylight fades and the mystical blue hour sets in, you stop in front of an endless palm grove. The scattered dates on the ground, nearly caramelized under the day’s scorching sun, release a deep, intoxicating aroma. Nearby, an oasis emerges, surrounded by orange blossoms, their delicate fragrance filling the twilight air. This journey, much like the fragrance itself, serves as a metaphor: sometimes, the destination is less important than the path taken, where every moment becomes a source of joy and wonder.\nThe bottle of Arabians Musk is an elegant work of art, offering a striking contrast to the deep-toned bottle of Arabians Tonka. This new release is encased in a soft lacquered brown, reminiscent of the smooth sweetness of ripe dates and the delicate white flowers found in Moroccan oases. This lighter hue reflects a balance between strength and softness, subtly connecting the robustness of horse-riding leather gear to the fragrance’s delicate sensuality. The bottle’s soft, glycerine-like finish mirrors the tactile smoothness of leather cared for with fine oils, a nod to the noble equestrian world. This smooth texture, combined with the warm, luminous brown, evokes both the sweetness of dates and the light floral notes of orange blossom, creating an object that is as sensual to the touch as the fragrance is to the senses.\nArabians Musk is not merely a fragrance; it is an invitation to a sensory journey, where each olfactory note is a new step on the path to discovery. Inspired by magical Moroccan nights and the world of noble horses, this fragrance is a captivating blend of musky sensuality and floral, sugary notes, offering a deeply luxurious and evocative experience. The bottle, with its soft lacquered brown hue, perfectly encapsulates the contrast between the rugged nobility of purebred horses and the delicate sweetness of the scent. Arabians Musk celebrates freedom, sensuality, and elegance, reminding us that the beauty of the journey is as much in the moments along the way as in the final destination..

January 2021, in my Parisian flat the time was numb, the days uncertain to the point of losing touch with our senses and with the others because they meant danger; in that enclosure I brought spontaneity into play to create a diversion and belie my thoughts. From this introspection – sometimes feverish, sometimes exhilarating, “Rauque” was born: a series of photographs blending suspended compositions and captured portraits. A?er all, freedom is not asked for, it is searched for and seized like an antidote.\n\nWith a glass plate device that dissolves the contours of my subjects, I wanted to engage in a dialogue with absence and presence, indoor and outdoor. The obliteration of the object which, through the viewer's imagination, takes shape, stimulating peripheral awareness. A struggle then begins between the image and its disappearance\n\nThe image is a flat envelope, not enough for me to fully translate the essence of my allegories. So, since 2014, I've been incorporating an olfactory dimension into my photographic series. This allows the viewer to access sensory perceptions additional to those of sight.

The waxy basement of a mushroom farm, a doughy Alep soap, a sticky piece of leather left in the back of a stable, the muzzle of a cow, an old box of Japanese incense smelling of ancient and dust, flowers marked by the patina of time or forgotten fruits with carnal accents, we censored nothing to best convey the idea of a feverish body surrounded by sleepy lives.

It will therefore come as no surprise that the result of this unique Polish-Italian cooperation is an incredibly enigmatic scent, thoroughly incense-like, completely enveloped in wisps of thick smoke.\nFrom the House of Merlo diary: “The dreamlike opening looms like a dreamy priest just after dusk, looking at the smoking elemi resin in which fragments of refreshing bergamot and lemon peel have congealed. The first aromas announcing the beginning of the ancient ritual quickly gain intensity when freshly ground pepper enters the censer, first a slightly more subtle, white variety, and then giving space to a much more wild and untamed black variety. The all-encompassing darkness encourages you to look towards the infinite universe, from the depths of which the ancient starlight illuminates the gray ribbons rising towards them, emerging from the glowing noble agarwood resin covered with damask rose petals, intricately combined with patchouli, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Just before dawn, when the night becomes darkest and everything around is pitch black, powerful, dark Frankish incense supports the ceremonial vigil. Arranged on cedar and sandalwood, wrapped in vanilla, sensual amber, and seductive musk, it recalls ancient times when man discovered fire and simultaneously experienced the extraordinary phenomenon of escaping smoke. Since the dawn of time, we have associated it with divinity, spirituality, and energy, and by observing it we believe that man is part of something bigger, not only the universe perceived through the senses. We are no longer surprised that in most parts of the world, the rite of incensation has become part of the most important ceremonies and rituals.

Captivated by the star-studded sky, the Gucci alchemist dreams of a new olfactory Gucci fragrance honouring the brightest star from the Lion constellation - Gucci The Heart of Leo. Guided by his brightness, the lion leaps from the sky in search of the world’s most precious ingredients. Knowing that resinous incense brings opulence to those who possess it, the lion jumps to the Arabic peninsula where Olibanum grows. Here, the noble creature encounters the tears of weeping trees, the bark exuding an unexpected, spicy scent that warms his heart. A symphony of balsamic resin traverses continents through golden winds, beckoning the lion to return to his homeland, Africa. As he follows the scent to yet another tree, he encounters the balsamic nectar of myrrh and its liquorice smoky undertones that liberate his soul. To sweeten his journey back to the moon, the lion garlands his mane in a blood-red blackcurrant accord. With the promise of dawn nearing, harmony returns as the lion resumes his position in the sky.

Because of the erotic effects of the high, the salve would often be rubbed directly onto a phallic object like the end of a staff or a broomstick. And so the popular image of witches riding on broomsticks has survived into our times, even if they rode them in a rather different sense.
