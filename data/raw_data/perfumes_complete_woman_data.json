      "detailed_description": "“Fragrance has always been a great love of mine, and I am fascinated with the power that scent can have and the way it can immediately transport you to a specific time and place in your life. Being allowed to become an ambassador for the new Burberry fragrance feels particularly special and personal.\nTo me, lionesses represent female unity and strength. They are confident and move together. Much like them, we stand on the shoulders of the women who came before us and those who bolster us throughout our own lives. To me, this image is a real source of empowerment.” - Emma Mackey, Burberry Beauty Ambassador\nBurberry unveils the new Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, a unique aromatic fragrance for women. The launch is supported by a campaign featuring British-French actress and new ambassador for Burberry Beauty, Emma Mackey.\nThe campaign presents a story of self-discovery inspired by the collective strength and power of the pride of lionesses. Created with live footage of lionesses in their natural environment and the latest CGI technology, Burberry creates an imaginary world where Emma Mackey and the pride come together as one.\nEmbodying the spirit of the Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, Emma channels the strength of the pride, igniting the power within to discover her inner confidence and ascend the peak ahead of her. Echoing Shygirl in the overlaid vocals, ‘one of me, but I’m not the only one, we are many burning like the sun’, the lionesses represent the collective power of female strength and support and the fact that together, we can all discover our inner goddess and achieve the extraordinary.\nA unique gourmand aromatic fragrance led by a powerful trio of distinct vanillas. Collected by hand, the beans dry in the sun for five to seven weeks. They are then stored in wooden boxes to mature and develop their sweet signature aroma.\n“My initial goal for Burberry Goddess was to expand upon the common use of vanilla to deliver a new kind of rich olfactive experience. For this purpose, I used three distinct types of vanilla extraction. The first is a vanilla infusion, which provides the brightest, woody vanilla possible. Then I used Firgood™ , also known as vanilla caviar, for the first time in a fragrance. This innovative new ingredient adds a sweet, rich, and animalic vanilla. Lastly, vanilla absolute is darker and richer, enhancing the fragrance with a mysterious, milky aspect.\"  - Amandine Clerc-Marie, Master Perfumer.\nDuring the process of creating the perfect vanilla accord, the precious vanilla was wrapped with notes of bright Lavender Diva essence from Provence and earthy notes of cocoa and ginger roots, creating an aromatic balance to each vanilla.\nOlfactive Pyramid\nTop: Vanilla Infusion and Lavender\nHeart: Vanilla Caviar\nBase: Vanilla Absolute\nFamily: Gourmand Aromatic\nMarking Burberry’s first-ever refillable fragrance, the bottle boasts an elegant design. The gabardine-inspired gold label on the outer casing references Burberry’s long-standing heritage, whilst the archive-inspired bottle is modernized with a gold medallion.\nBurberry Goddess is available\nin 10 ml, 30 ml, 50 ml, and 100 ml bottles.\nBurberry Goddess Shower Gel,\nBody Lotion and Refill (150ml) complete the collection.",

A fountain gleams in the centre, its marble edge covered in scarlet roses whose voluptuous scent meets that of leathery Saffron threads laid on the floor.\n \nThrough Jasmine screens, sultry and spent, the woman walks and there comes with her a scent of dark Vanilla and skinlike Sandalwood, of ambery Labdanum and purring hints of regal Orientalgris: who are you, she asks, and you feel seen.\n \nA spellbinding and novel interpretation of the Amouage triad of Rose, Frankincense and Orientalgris, Guidance reads like a poem, smells like an embrace, and feels like a word of wisdom.",

Valaya is reminiscent of the feel of cotton against the skin. A cocoon-like perfume that is sensual and elegant at the same time. A white perfume full of contrasts that is delicate yet incredibly alluring.” – Julien Sprecher (brand creator)",

      "detailed_description": "CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE charmed the world with its joyous, lively, and sparkling scent. Now, CHANEL presents a new, dazzling and elegant interpretation of it. A new chance is within reach.\n2002: CHANEL unveils CHANCE, a gleeful and optimistic floral fragrance creation. A name redolent of success and achievement. “Chance is a way of being”, said Gabrielle Chanel. It is no coincidence; it must be created, honed, sought out. It is the product of effort and passion. Four interpretations of this now-iconic scent emerged, including CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, a floral-sparkling fragrance with a modern, sophisticated, and decidedly light trail that features notes of jasmine and zesty citron paired with a teak wood accord. An invigorating composition with charming optimism.\n2023: CHANEL reinterprets CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette, creating a version that combines the density of an Eau de Parfum with the brightness of the Eau de Toilette. For this unique composition, CHANEL Perfumer-Creator Olivier Polge amplified the intensity without overpowering its freshness—a challenge he met with great success. CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum has the same spontaneous, lively nature as the Eau de Toilette, but leaves behind a more intense trail. Rather than merely adjust the concentration, the perfumer composed something completely new, a fragrance in its own right. The citron accord has become exhilarating without losing its original juiciness; the jasmine is richer and more intense; and the teak wood accord reveals a more ambery facet, giving it a certain elegance.\nOLIVIER POLGE CHANEL IN-HOUSE PERFUMER-CREATOR\nWhat was the creative process behind CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum?\nIt involved making subtle changes in order to amplify the sensations provided by the Eau de Toilette. The idea was to go to extremes, to push the fresh notes even further, through citrus, and to add density with the base notes, ambery notes, for more vibration. The challenge with this was to increase its intensity, bring out the base notes, and add depth, all while maintaining its fresh quality.\nIs this Eau de Parfum a radical departure from the spirit of the Eau de Toilette?\nThey have the same fresh, colorful scent profile, with jasmine being the common thread that connects them. This new version is more textured and ambery than the Eau de Toilette. To achieve that, intensity has been brought to every layer of the composition (top, heart, base).\n\nHow would you describe the difference between CHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Toilette and Eau de Parfum?\nThe Eau de Parfum is a fresh, woody scent that opens with a burst of zest that is even more invigorating and exhilarating than before, accentuated by a hint of aldehydes. In this variation, the floral heart of jasmine is richer and adds a luminous, full-bodied quality. The teak wood accord and its intensified ambery notes add richness and depth for a more present trail.\nCHANCE EAU FRAÎCHE Eau de Parfum is available in sizes of 50ml and 100m starting August 2023.",

Underlined, like a stroke of shade intensifying the radiance of an afternoon in the sun, by the smoky earthiness of vetiver...\n\nThe first of a constellation of floral fragrances, Tilia is also, for its creator Marc-Antoine Barrois and his long-time accomplice, the perfumer Quentin Bisch, the name of an imaginary star.

      "detailed_description": "Fève Gourmande is the new name for Gourmand Coquin.\n\"A symbol of gourmet delight, the cocoa accord reveals chocolate notes that are equally sweet and bitter. Fève Gourmande plays on this contrast, moving from gourmandise to the point of excess. This loss of olfactory reference points creates a delectably surrealist cocoa. \n\nFloral and majestic rose shakes up the cocoa accord, heady with rum and spice notes. At the base, the woody elegance of patchouli warmed by the heat of smoky tea adds mystery to the chocolatey notes, revealing a new sensuality.\nCocoa is olfactively expressed in the form of an accord, composed by the perfumer. This accord with chocolatey, and delicately bitter notes gives the perfume a sensory, gourmand feel.\nBetween the gourmet pleasure of chocolate, the vertigo of rum notes and the refinement of rose, the cocoa note tips into an alternative reality.\n\n“If it were a painting, it would be a surrealist work by Salvador Dalí.”\n\nFève Gourmande distorts the vision of gourmandise and transforms the cocoa accord into an incredibly addictive delight, like a surrealist painting by Salvador Dalí in which reality and dream combine, defying all logic.\"\nTaking inspiration from the Guerlain heritage Square Bottle (1870), the L’Art & La Matière bottle is an exceptional object. Made by Pochet du Courval – the House’s historic glassmaker – it is endlessly refillable at selected Guerlain Boutiques.\n\"Normally associated with childhood, cocoa reveals a new maturity. In Fève Gourmande, it is singularly blended with the depth of a smoky tea accord and the luminous elegance of rose.\" - Delphine Jelk, Guerlain Perfumer.\nAvailable in 100 and 200ml Eau de Parfum.",

      "detailed_description": "Olivier Polge asserts: \"At the beginning of each creation, an element of inspiration is necessary and, in COMÈTE, the starting point was the idea of stardust. The comet is a strong symbol for CHANEL, and I am thinking in particular of the Comète pendant from the 1932 high jewelry collection. \"When worn open and placed directly on the skin, it evokes the enveloping effect of a perfume on the skin\".\nWith intensely floral and luminous notes, COMÈTE explores a new olfactory identity in the LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL collection. Rich, elegant, and complex in nature, the Eau de Parfum is infused with the refreshing aroma of cherry blossoms, and this touch of brightness and purity transforms into a halo with notes of heliotrope blending with iris extract and musk harmony. This captivating fragrance, which envelops the skin in a mysterious charm, pays homage to its unique personality.\nCOMÈTE is a trail of stardust and a celestial jewel that chooses its own path and never deviates from it, reflecting Gabrielle Chanel. It is a halo of light, spreading a force of optimism for those who are convinced that the planets will align with their lucky star.\nMore unique and valuable than any other collection, the LES EXCLUSIFS DE CHANEL collection is embodied in a bottle with excellent and simple design, focusing all attention on the fragrance. COMÈTE is packaged in a sleek and timeless glass bottle with a black cap signed with the brand's monogram. Its box brings simplicity to the level of luxury and sophistication, taking the form of an elegant white jewelry box with a black trim.\nResembling a heritage seal, this delicate two-tone aesthetic accompanies the launch of COMÈTE, a special limited edition: an embossed representation of the legendary Comète necklace, created in 1932, seductively embracing all four sides of the box. In a final tribute to the brilliance of diamonds and stardust, the Double C logo on top of the box is highlighted with silver ink.",

      "detailed_description": "\"Rediscover the trail of Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet through a fragrant declaration of love narrated by Natalie Portman, where the freshness of rose and peony notes mingle with the caress of a white musk veil.\nMiss Dior Blooming Bouquet Eau de Toilette has been composed like a floral embrace, both lively and tender. It is a faceted and spontaneous bouquet of newly blossomed flowers. Its contrasting trail opens with the intensity of the feeling of love at sight, conveyed in the lively notes of sweet pea and bergamot. \n\nA duo of Damascus rose and peony notes then unfurls with nobleness, like a passionate and radiant emotion. A soft, light accord of white musks rounds off the bouquet of this fragrance that tells the story of love.\n\nThe Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet fragrance is housed in a bottle with an elevated identity: the Miss Dior bow, woven with multicolored Lurex threads for a \"Millefiori\" effect, gives the fragrance an added couture detail. This ingenious jacquard bow, inspired by a bouquet of a thousand colored flowers, was crafted in the guarded workshops of one of the most renowned French ribbon-makers: Maison Faure, founded in 1864.\"\nAvailable as 30, 50, 100, and 150ml EDT.",

A floral-woody-green fragrance with perfect balance. The last fragrance launched and worn by Gabrielle Chanel. An uncompromising composition, in the image of Mademoiselle.\nA daring floral-woody-green fragrance that plays with contrasts. A perfect balance between the vibrant, green notes of Galbanum and the soft, powdery notes of Iris Pallida.\"\n\"The last fragrance Gabrielle Chanel ever launched or wore. A fragrance that pays tribute to the day she was born: August 19, 1883.  When the idea for this new women's fragrance came to mind, she met with resistance from those around her who did not think a new fragrance could exist alongside N°5. But Coco refused to give up and asked Henri Robert for a composition with a personality just as strong as that of N°5. And her request was granted, in a completely different olfactory composition: a contrasting accord of green and powdery notes. Mademoiselle passed away just a few weeks after the launch of the new fragrance, on January 10, 1971.\"\n\nAvailable in 100ml Eau de Toilette.",

I owe my first olfactory memories to you : rhubarb tart, Auton pear jam, egg cream and all the other desserts I've patiently prepared alongside you.\nThis Blue Madeleine fragrance is for you.»\nIntimately linked to emotions, olfactive memory has the ability to revive deeply buried memories with intense vividness. A simple inhalation of a familiar scent can transport you instantaneously to a precise moment in your past, evoking long-forgotten sensations, emotions and experiences. Perfume, like the most powerful of all memories, awakens the olfactory memory that makes us suddenly and intensely relive those moments.\n\"...I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the cake. No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the crumbs touched my palate than a shudder ran through me and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me.

Overdosed with natural tonka and a hint of coumarin, the deliciousness of the tonka bean is intoxicating, in an ultimate concentration of 30%.\n\nGuerlain Perfumers enhance the almond facet of the tonka bean by enriching it with bitter almond essence and a microdose of coumarin. Pushing the addiction to its peak, the tonka bean becomes burning on contact with vanilla, cocoa and hot spices.\n\nTonka Sarrapia Extrait 75 is part of the Les Extraits Signature extract collection which embodies the quintessence of Guerlain trail. Paying homage to the alchemy of Guerlinade – the emblematic signature of the House – The Signature Extracts highlight each of the six raw materials that compose it and reveal its golden ratio.",

      "detailed_description": "Included in the first-ever NISHANE collection launched globally in the year 2015, WŪLÓNG CHÁ has reached a huge fanbase worldwide thanks to the journey it takes the wearer to the serene tea gardens of the Far East, where the delicate notes of oolong tea leaves and Mediterranean fig fill the air. The original WŪLÓNG CHÁ has been celebrated mainly because of its robust power of refreshing notes. However, WŪLÓNG CHÁ X is designed to mute the sharp edges of the original formula and enhance it with the addition of florals namely magnolia. This fragrance opens with a burst of zesty citrus notes of bergamot, orange, mandarin, and yuzu, transporting the wearer to the sunny shores of the Mediterranean. As the scent settles, the heart notes of magnolia, thyme oil, and green tea weave a magical spell around you, evoking the tranquil stillness of a teatime. Finally, the musk and fig base notes provide a warm and grounding finish to this fragrance that will keep the wearer feeling fresh and revitalized all day.\nTOP NOTES\nbergamot - yuzu - litsea - mandarin\nHEART NOTES\nmagnolia - thyme oil - green tea\nBASE NOTES\nmusk - fig",

Made in Italy  using only the highest quality raw materials, these fragrances are brought to life by the  craftsmanship and attention to detail inherent in Dolce&Gabbana’s DNA, characterized by  the majolica print that embellishes the iconic bottles.\nCrafted by master perfumer Olivier Cresp, the iconic fragrance Light Blue is tinged with novelty thanks to its fruity notes and woody touch. Keeping the classic base of fresh citrus, flowers, and warm notes, this rendition opens with notes of Calabrian Bergamot. The heart of the fragrance reveals the sweetness of ripe peaches. As a finishing touch, the pleasant woody warmth of amber.\nLight Blue Summer Vibes comes in an elegant rectangular glass bottle, while Light Blue Summer Vibes  Pour Homme comes in a trapezoidal bottle with soft lines. Both feature the classic silhouette of Light  Blue fragrances and are embellished with a white cap.\nThe campaign is an homage to spontaneity and passion. The protagonists, the iconic couple Bianca Balti and David Gandy under the shade of the Faraglioni amidst the crystal-clear waters surrounding the spellbinding Capri Island. From the boat to the shore, right up to the sun-drenched terrace steeped in scents of lemon trees, the couple shares intimate moments of smiles, jokes, and passion. An intense and profound attraction that captures the energy of summer on the seaside. Director Steve Brahms unveils intimate glimpses of a shared life full of tenderness and love with the notes of the song Parlami d’amore Mariù in the background.",

The new floral Eau de Parfum is composed of a heart built around Iris Concrete and three different rose extracts: fresh rose water, sensual damascena absolue and space rose accord. Its floral heart is enhanced by an enveloping signature with woody musk undertones.\nThe iconic smile of La Vie Est Belle is reinvented by the renowned artist Catherine Krunas, making way for a sculpted rose at the heart of the bottle. Each petal pays tribute to all the facets of women. In the hands of three French master perfumers in pursuit of the perfect rose, La Vie Est Belle Rose Extraordinaire emerges as a modern interpretation of the iconic flower of perfumery.\n'La Vie Est Belle Rose Extraordinaire is a modern interpretation of the Rose, the iconic flower of perfumery,' as beautifully put by Anne Flippo, perfumer. It's a testament to the dedication and artistry of those who crafted this extraordinary fragrance.\nInspired by rose petals, the wings of La Vie Est Belle Rose Extraordinaire transition from white to pink, accentuated with a touch of silver glitter.\"\nAvailable in 30, 50 and 100ml Eau de Parfum Florale.",

Orris creates soft focus; a velvety fuzz under Renaissance skies.\nBut the plot soon thickens. Childish naivete gives way to adult sensuality underscored by sensual musks heated by the scorching afternoon sun. Spices emerge—cardamom, ginger, cinnamon. Bark threatens to turn into wood; these amber daggers are hard.\nWith one sip of amaretto, you’re reminded that even a sweet peach’s stone can be poisonous. When danger threatens, you’ve got to be Machiavellian. Peach’s Revenge is a dish best spritzed cold, but not without the warmth of body heat.\"\nNotes : peach, guava, nectarine, amaretto, orris, cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, bark, amber, vanilla, caramel, musks.\nAvailable in 50ml Extrait de Parfum.",

Originally introduced as separate fragrances for men and women in 2009, APOM has been reimagined by perfumer Francis Kurkdjian to combine the best elements of both versions. Inspired by the perfumer's visit to Lebanon, APOM is a flowery amber fougere built on a classic structure with a modern twist. The luminous top of orange blossom gives way to the beauty of aromatic lavender, leading to an alluring base of vanillic amber, comforting white musk, and the sunny smile of ylang-ylang.",

This is followed by the grand floral quartet of Rose, Orange Blossom, Carnation, and Ylang-Ylang: vivid, uncompromising ingredients that combine all their many shades and textures to create a vision of femininity that is now even more regal, even more graceful. In the closing stages, Orris, Sandalwood, and Amyris glow with a luminous aura: a regal shimmer beneath the vibrant intensity of the flowers.

And when the coo of the owl breaks the night, the mice dash, trembling, back to their nests.\nLike a countryside bathed in sweet sunlight, Harvest Mouse by Zoologist conjures images of home-baked goodness. Stalks of wheat sway among chamomile, davana and hay, and rich beer extracts are sobered by resins and woody notes. Cozy up in a warm nest of homespun scent.",

      "detailed_description": "KILIAN launches the latest addition to its Smokes Collection called Smoking Hot in late September 2023. The fragrance offers a fusion of sweetness and smokiness, reminiscent of delectable caramel.\nWith a contemporary take on the smoky essence, this creation not only redefines the genre for modern sensibilities but also encapsulates an element of scorching allure. The heart of the fragrance is steeped in the lusciousness of caramel, blending the robust depth of Kentucky tobacco absolute and apple shisha. The bold undertones of Bourbon vanilla further contribute to the untamed and opulent nature of this olfactory composition.\nThe scent opens with apples, and the warm cinnamon bark essence is added to the mellow apple hookah. Then, slowly over time, smoked Kentucky tobacco absolute emerges. A rich tobacco absolute blends with oak moss, followed by Bourbon vanilla with balsamic notes. Orkanox is added to Bourbon Vanilla, also known as Pure Jungle Essence, to express its powerful and sensual charm with a scent.\nThe exquisite \"Smoking Hot\" is elegantly presented as a 50ml Eau de Parfum, encapsulating the essence of this alluring fusion within its meticulously crafted formulation.",

      "detailed_description": "Café Tabac - A hedonistic scent that celebrates the undocumented moment.\nA sumptuous party that goes on for days. Endless dinners and all-night merengue dancing under charcoal skies. Smoke meets flower and spice settles in for the next inhale. This is CAFÉ TABAC.\nBefore Aedes de Venustas’s newest scent was realized in a bottle, it had a name: CAFÉ TABAC, inspired by the iconic 90s bar in the East Village. Upstairs at Cafe Tabac was where Kate met Johnny, Madonna picked up the phone, Leo picked up supermodels. It was a place where the truly glamorous could be truly off-duty, an unselfconscious, pre-cell phone era that feels so far away as to be longed for again.\n“It’s the deep mood of a place to be, creating its own legend,” says perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour. “The deep blue smoke of cigarettes, cigars, weed … whatever. We’re exploring other paradises: laughs, desires, and pleasures, again and again.”\nThat spirit was also present when Duchaufour and Gerstner went to visit the Dominican Republic last year for another scented project. “It was an explosion of vibrant and chic people from Mexico, France, Rio, New York; different cultures and conversations and ideas and opinions,” says Gerstner. “We went from a tropical forest to the coast together, but it wasn’t until we were standing in a cigar factory that I looked at Bertrand and said, ‘Can you put this in a bottle?’”\nThe result is as dazzling, sexy, and complex as the trip: It opens with sparkling notes of expected (bergamot) and unexpected (apple, tamarind) fruits but the overall perfume is an homage to tobacco in many forms. Dry leaves, humid flowers, and a cigar lit by fire are represented thanks to herbal clary sage and davana, a tint of mango with dried fig and date, and a rough smokiness using tobacco absolute, tar, cade, and cedarwood. An amber accord of secretions and sugars from cistus and labdanum, ambergris, oakmoss, vanilla, cacao accord and Peru balm at the heart gives way to a darkly rich and resinous base. There is no saccharine here. Instead, distinctive burnt sugar and fresh clove and cardamom are infused with vapors that keep CAFE TABAC multilayered instead of perfectly round. It is blended at a twenty percent concentration made in the old school haute parfumerie style, including a month-long maceration in France.\nWith CAFE TABAC, there is a mad sensuality that feels like the olfactive equivalent of a twist of orange atop a demitasse of espresso—rich with a touch of freshness and tang. To wear it is to maintain a state of heightened emotions that are sooner remembered than they are recorded.",

The truth is often hidden behind appearances. Graceful, delicate and ethereal, a ballerina seems manipulated like a doll, by an elegant puppeteer. Slender dandy with spider fingers, the fate of the little one is in his hands. Precarious balance, fatally inevitable destiny! However, between the executioner and his intended victim, are things so obvious? On closer inspection, wouldn't she also be pulling the wires on her side, giving direction to the emaciated fingers? The orphan, fascinating actress of our illusions! When reality resurfaces, letting doubt settle in, it evaporates into a mystical and disturbing incense. Serge Lutens",

The floral freshness of orange blossom harmonizes with an animalic accord. The inspiration for this scent is drawn from the materials that decorate the boutique, including window glass, concrete, and white stone, infusing it with freshness and luminosity. Together, they embody a mineral design approach – mirroring the essence of the perfume itself.\nAvailable in 100ml EDP.",

It’s a planet covered with warm velvet dunes where the spicy and caramelized everlasting flower is preponderant. The fiery heart of this fragrance reminds us that the gods gave Ganymede eternal life so that his beauty would never fade. Is it the smoldering skin hidden underneath the wild leather? This precious perfume extract is as much a sophisticated perfume as a carnal one.\nGanymede EXTRAIT unfolds in its dizzying trail the seduction of great Classics.\nThe sound of the waves from far away. The wind is sweeping a field of everlasting flowers. The sun takes out its right and heats the spicy, almost syrupy scent of these yellow flowers. The waves are caressing the dune.\nThe wind picks up the sand into warm, leathery, heady gusts- incense, myrrhe? Grains of sand are twirling, incandescent. The rock is flushing, the Akigalawood and Mandarin bring minerals and freshness. The air becomes… captivating.",

      "detailed_description": "Englewood, New Jersey—Commodity, the modern American perfumery, emphasizes the importance of the journey with the launch of their latest fragrance, JUICE. This new addition comes three years after their bestseller, Milk.\nThe delay in launching JUICE stems from its unexpected development. Originally, Commodity planned to release a “non-floral floral” fragrance and explored over 50 samples without finding the desired impact. The breakthrough came when perfumer Nathalie Benareau of Symrise presented a fruit-forward fragrance with a distinct floral background that captured their attention, prompting a shift in direction.\n“The goal was never to launch a new fragrance just for the sake of novelty,” said Vicken Arslanian, Commodity's Re-Founder and Brand Architect. “We took our time developing the right fit, even if it diverged from our initial plan.”\n“JUICE is unlike anything else in our lineup, and I’m excited for customers to explore its three variations,” Arslanian added.\nJUICE joins Commodity’s Scent Space Collection, available in three distinct versions: Juice- Personal, Juice Expressive, and Juice+ Bold. Each iteration reimagines a traditional juicy fragrance with tantalizing notes of Strawberry, Raspberry, and Rhubarb. The differences among the versions are highlighted by additional key notes, which alter the projection and define their respective Scent Space:\nJuice- Personal: This closely-projecting personal skin scent features fresh Violet Leaf, offering a sparkling interpretation of JUICE that showcases the transparent side of ripe red fruits.\nJuice Expressive: This noticeably unique version blends perfectly ripe Strawberry, Rhubarb, and Raspberry Pulp until smooth, with a base of Orientalwood.\nJuice+ Bold: This room-filling rendition is steeped in Vetiver and Patchouli, resulting in a jammier interpretation of JUICE.\nAvailable as a 100ml Eau de Parfum, and in travel 10ml size.",

Filippo emphasizes these moments by interpreting in olfaction some passages from Mark's Gospel, particularly the moment of the Women's astonishment and fear when they realize that the stone of the Sepulcher has rolled away. In an ideal image to describe this moment, the bottle the very expensive aloe- and myrrh-based aromatic oils that they had prepared to anoint Jesus' body is dropped to the ground the moment they saw not only the stone rolled away, but all the white linen cloths that wrapped the body. Hence the announcement of a young man dressed in blazing white.... The bottle along with the four \"wings\" that open as \"ritual\" are covered with sand, with dust, just to remind us of the steps, the road and the place. But the attention-blocking element is the cap that mimics the stylistic features of the tombstone that has rolled away, just as they used to be built. The artwork is covered in its entirety by a white linen veil, on which the name of the fragrance is reproduced: HÆEC DIES. The outside of the packaging is also covered with the same linen.",

Prolonging this intensity, a signature Guerlain amber accord – Shalimar opopanine – reveals a trail as powerful as a base note, carried by the woody and smoky facets of Gaïac wood essence.\n\nBergamot Fantastico Extrait 11 is part of the Les Extraits Signature extract collection which embodies the quintessence of Guerlain trail.

      "detailed_description": "Hexensalbe is a dark floral fragrance, rooted in the botanical underworld of witchcraft.\nHexensalbe, also known as witches’ flying ointment, was a hallucinogenic salve used in witchcraft in the middle ages. It was a mixture of extremely poisonous ingredients that produced an ecstatic trance with powerful sensations of flying, images of otherworldly creatures and a primal sexual hunger.\nThe ointment was so poisonous that eating it would be directly fatal, instead it was applied to other soft membranes of the body, armpits and more commonly the genitals. Because of the erotic effects of the high, the salve would often be rubbed directly onto a phallic object like the end of a staff or a broomstick. And so the popular image of witches riding on broomsticks has survived into our times, even if they rode them in a rather different sense. There are records from the 1200’s and forward where women have been found naked in a delirious trance, pleasuring themselves with the spicy devil’s dildo.",

Such is the splendor you will experience within The Language of Glaciers, a romantic epic which reaches incredible heights and inspires one to leave no moment unappreciated. From the stillness of a moonlit snowshoe excursion, to the rush of witnessing an avalanche safely from above, the recollections of our unnamed narrator will captivate you the same way the solitary song of the snow owl captivated them. Find comfort in the cold and begin to see the world from stunning new perspectives. Critics have called it “A slow-paced story that will burrow straight to the center of your soul” and “Sharp as ice and smooth as a glacial lake.”\nNOTES:\nWhite Pine, Lilac, Cashmere, Juniper, Forget Me Not, Blue Bugle, Virgin Snowfall.",

Using headspace technology, which allows the natural aromatic compounds exhaled by the flowers to be collected under a glass dome, dahlias release their aromas in a pure state, intact and wild, so that perfumers can recreate them with a natural and spontaneous olfactory identity.\nIts signature, a subtle blend of Rosa Damascena and White Musks, opens to fresh new facets: the acidity of bright yellow mandarin, the spiciness of a pink Dahlia accord, and the sweetness of Tonka Bean.\nTop notes: Yellow mandarin essence, Pink pepper extract\nHeart notes: Dahlia, Rosa Damascena Essence\nBase Notes: Vanilla, White Musk, Tonka Bean\nAvailable in 40 and 75 ml Eau de Parfum.",

A pure, delicate and sunny rose, shaped instinctively.\"\nTHE DOMAIN OF THE ROSE: THE CULTURE OF AN INIMITABLE ROSE, ON THE EARTH WHERE NATURE LIVES IN THE WILD STATE\nDiscover Absolue Les Parfums, the first collection of high perfumery dedicated to the rose grown at the heart of our estate: the Centifolia Rose. Composed of 11 exceptional juices, it reveals an exclusive rose like you've never smelled before.\nTHE REINVENTION OF THE ICONIC INGREDIENT OF PERFUMERY\nOur Master Perfumers have freed themselves from the classic olfactory pyramid and invented a new way of constructing a perfume with the construction of the halo. The rose becomes the heart of an olfactory symphony. Each fragrance in the Absolue Les Parfums collection is born from the fusion of Lancôme's exclusive rose and an element of nature emblematic of the rose domain.",

      "detailed_description": "\"I have always believed that perfume is (synonymous with) pleasure. I named the collection Oudgasm because I wanted something that was just as bold as the juices themselves! Out of all the fragrance notes in the world, oud has always given me this incredibly euphoric feeling that is both transformative and transportive - as if it exists in its own universe. My love for oud turned into passion once I moved to the Middle East over 20 years ago where I truly embraced the ritual of layering with it as an act of self expression and self love. The intensity, the richness and the beauty of this ingredient can tell so many stories - so when I started working on Oudgasm, I knew it couldn’t be bottled in just one fragrance! I wanted to explore oud and all of its brilliant facets in hopes that, you too, will fall in love.\" - Mona Kattan",

What adventure: the seduction swirls from dimmed hotel rooms clouded with bold florals and spicy peppercorn to intimate walks of the city's winding streets at midnight, imbued with a trail of smoky masculine notes.\n\nEach responsibly-crafted fragrance is bottled in a flacon inspired by a vintage parfum bottle Victoria collected while traveling. The white enamel of the Suite 302 bottle is reminiscent of the little white Roberto Cavalli dress Victoria wore for her surprise vow renewal with David.\n\"This fragrance captures the memories of David and I in Paris. This is the city we sneak off to, it is always our happy place, whether for an occasional weekend, or a birthday, or anniversary, I’ve always felt a natural connection to Paris.\" xVB",

I named the collection Oudgasm because I wanted something that was just as bold as the juices themselves! Out of all the fragrance notes in the world, oud has always given me this incredibly euphoric feeling that is both transformative and transportive - as if it exists in its own universe. My love for oud turned into passion once I moved to the Middle East over 20 years ago where I truly embraced the ritual of layering with it as an act of self expression and self love. The intensity, the richness and the beauty of this ingredient can tell so many stories - so when I started working on Oudgasm, I knew it couldn’t be bottled in just one fragrance! I wanted to explore oud and all of its brilliant facets in hopes that, you too, will fall in love.\" - Mona Kattan",

      "detailed_description": "Clary Sage Eau de Parfum Intense is a fantastic journey outside and inside us: it is walking on an imaginary path that reconnects us to nature, offering a sweeping bird's-eye view of everything and simultaneously profound introspection within ourselves. It is a tribute to one’s ability to disengage from a physical place — such as a frenetic city like Milan — and the present.  It is knowing how to be on the \"Streets of Milan\" yet in an abstract ‘elsewhere’. To create this transcendental effect, perfumer Julie Massé harmonized a bouquet of essences with a woody scent known in ancient medicinal wisdom for their relaxing and invigorating power. Clary Sage Eau de Parfum Intense has a charismatic personality that takes advantage of the presence of an extraordinary millèsime  ingredient, the concrete of Blue Hemlock, a conifer with greenish-blue reflections and fresh, vigorous notes able to convey an extraordinary relaxing effect.\n\nClary Sage has a bright and energetic overture that comes from the semi-sweet, tart notes of grapefruit essential oil and those of Clary Sage [Salvia Sclarea], famous in phytotherapy for its healing, if not salvific, properties, as the Latin name infers. In perfumery it is loved for its fresh, spicy and herbaceous olfactory imprint. Furthermore, Sclareol is extracted through the steam distillation of Clary Sage leaves and flowers, whose aromatic and woody notes add depth and complexity to the fragrance and also help improve its persistence. In the heart notes, we find the millèsime ingredient, Blue Hemlock concrete, whose vibrant, aromatic notes instill a feeling of relaxation and a desire to merge with nature. The woody accord is completed by the fresh, spicy notes of Balsam Fir Absolute, which invite mental clarity, and the sweet and luminous notes of Myrtle. Finally, the essence of Patchouli with its magical and aphrodisiacal notes enriches the fragrance. To fix the bouquet, two synthetic molecules were used: Vegan Ambrettolide, a synthetic molecule with delicate musky notes that increases the persistence of the fragrance, and Orcanox™ — synthesized from Sclareol — replacing ambergris of animal origin with fixative properties and powdery, sensual notes.\nJulie Massé: “I wanted to create something unusual and provocative, strong enough to induce a dizzying sense of pleasure in which the unexpected note of Hemlock meets an enveloping note of Balsam Fir and a hypnotic note of Clary Sage.”\nTOP NOTES: Grapefruit Essential Oil, Clary Sage Essential Oil\nHEART NOTES: Myrtle Essential Oil, Hemlock Concrete, Balsam Fir Absolute                                 \nBASE NOTES: Vegan Ambrettolide, Patchouli Essential Oil, Orcanox ™\nOLFACTIVE FAMILY: Woody / Aromatic / Addictive",

It takes inspiration from Kiphy, the traditional Egyptian perfume, but adds a modern twist, in line with The Merchant of Venice's approach of blending historical recipes with innovative elements.\nTop notes: Blue lotus, Saffron, Cinnamon bark\nMiddle notes: Kyphi accord, Incense, Oriental\nBase notes: Sandalwood, Tonka bean, Myrrh\nAvailable as a 100ml Eau de Parfum.",

Creamy caramel covers the blend with its lactonic and slightly salty personality. Tonka bean combines with the carnal sensation of honey, while white musk pieces everything together in a clean and comforting fashion. Vanilla occupies the base to build upon the sweetness and the white milk accord. White Milk is designed to bring about a sense of warmth and comforting familiarity.",

      "detailed_description": "The sun sparkled across rippling waves, its morning dance upon the Indian Ocean rousing the dodos from their carefree slumber. Stumbling drunkenly across the forest floor they feasted on overripe fruit where it lay, dropped for them by the lush island paradise that nurtured them. For generations, the predator-free and bountiful shores lulled them into such a state of complacency that their wings grew idle, and flight was lost – even to memory. Ultimately evolution would betray them, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort.\nIn Zoologist Dodo, notes of jackfruit and bergamot border a winding path dappled with aromatic turmeric and pink pepper. Venture along it to the heart of an island forest where hints of powdery orris emerge from beneath a potpourri of lavender, geranium, and orange flower. Soothed by the comforting florals, you’ll soon surrender, sinking into the loam where woody tonka and sandalwood sprout from an earthy base of patchouli and vetiver.",

      "detailed_description": "Burning with fiery fire, the rose is fearless and dangerous. Combined with deep patchouli, it becomes indomitable. Her defiant spirit is matched only by her legendary beauty. Meeting deep, masculine vetiver, perfectly paired with earthy patchouli, our rose is sensual yet balanced and harmonious.\nThe vision of the Master Perfumer, Daphné Bugey:\n\"Between elegance and carnal extravagance, a rose dressed in the depths of woods and amber... I was inspired by the duality of the rose, between its elegance and its sensuality.\"\nTHE DOMAIN OF THE ROSE: THE CULTURE OF AN INIMITABLE ROSE, ON THE EARTH WHERE NATURE LIVES IN THE WILD STATE\nDiscover Absolue Les Parfums, the first haute perfumery collection dedicated to the rose grown at the heart of our estate: the Centifolia Rose. Composed of 11 exceptional juices, it reveals an exclusive rose like you've never smelled before.\nTHE REINVENTION OF THE ICONIC INGREDIENT OF PERFUMERY\nOur Master Perfumers have freed themselves from the classic olfactory pyramid and invented a new way of constructing a perfume with the halo construction. The rose becomes the heart of an olfactory symphony. Each perfume in the Absolue Les Parfums collection is born from the fusion of the exclusive Lancôme rose and an element of nature emblematic of the rose domain.",

      "detailed_description": "Gucci’s The Alchemist’s Garden is a Luxury Collection of sophisticated Eau de Parfums, Perfumed Oils, and Acque Profumate inspired by the art of alchemy. Captivated by the star-studded sky, the Gucci alchemist dreams of a new olfactory Gucci fragrance honouring the brightest star from the Lion constellation - Gucci The Heart of Leo. Guided by his brightness, the lion leaps from the sky in search of the world’s most precious ingredients. Knowing that resinous incense brings opulence to those who possess it, the lion jumps to the Arabic peninsula where Olibanum grows. Here, the noble creature encounters the tears of weeping trees, the bark exuding an unexpected, spicy scent that warms his heart. A symphony of balsamic resin traverses continents through golden winds, beckoning the lion to return to his homeland, Africa. As he follows the scent to yet another tree, he encounters the balsamic nectar of myrrh and its liquorice smoky undertones that liberate his soul. To sweeten his journey back to the moon, the lion garlands his mane in a blood-red blackcurrant accord. With the promise of dawn nearing, harmony returns as the lion resumes his position in the sky. Happy with the lion’s fabled journey, the Gucci alchemist carefully encases the fruity, ambery elixir– and its night-sky-inspired story – in a black lacquered bottle. Much like the alchemist's ability to transform all that he touches into newfound wonders, this unisex Gucci fragrance is manufactured using alcohol made from 100% recycled carbon emissions.\nCapturing the spirit of nature and distilling it into exquisite elixirs, The Alchemist’s Garden collection is composed of customisable Gucci fragrances intended to be layered together.\nEach olfactory creation draws on a hero ingredient that changes and magnifies its character when worn with other Gucci scents.\nThe beauty of alchemy lies in the transformation: layered aromas that become new expressions of art and unfold the magic of unseen worlds.\nThe Gucci Heart of Leo unisex Gucci Eau de Parfum offers six recommended layering combinations, each designed to bring out the richness and opulence of its warm facets captured by its golden mane.\nCreate a warm incense with Gucci The Eyes of The Tiger.\nWhen applied with Gucci The Heart of Leo, the blend of Incense, Myrrh & Oriental captivates with its golden intensity.\nEnvision a floral tapestry woven with the opulent Damask Rose essence of Gucci A Reason to Love.\nIncense, Myrrh & Rose-infused Oud Accord summon sultry depths, revealing a gourmand and floral bouquet of aromas.|Add a touch of sweetness to the Myrrh with Gucci A Chant for the Nymph.\nInfuse floral undertones into Incense & Myrrh with the Frangipani accord to create a sweet incense.\nEnhance the Gucci fragrance’s rich character with Gucci A Forgotten Rose Perfumed Oil.\nA fresh Rose combined with Incense & Myrrh enriches the composition with its symphony of warm and fresh aromas.\nEnvelop yourself in the magic of the night with Gucci Moonlight Serenade Acqua Profumata.\nA Musky Lavender invigorates the ambery blend of Incense & Myrrh, infusing a sense of freshness into the composition.\nUnveil the richness of the ambery facets with Gucci A Forgotten Rose Perfumed Oil and Gucci Moonlight Serenade Acqua Profumata.\nRose & Lavender introduce floral hints to the Incense & Myrrh in this ambery aromatic olfactory creation.",

Artifacts of a life being lived populate your space, untidy and endearing: the leather jacket left behind by a lover lazily draped on the sofa, your vanity clumsy with perfumes and jewelry, the littered ashtray on your windowsill.

From the solitude of your dressing table, you stare at your reflection with no one else to see. The phone rings.",

There were numerous European attempts to cultivate pods outside their original cradle. Louis XIV fell in love with it and wanted to cultivate it on Bourbon Island, in Reunion. But all attempts under his reign failed. No one knew how to fertilize vanilla outside its native area. Europeans were unaware that the Mexican Melipona bee was responsible for pollination. Indeed, thanks to it, the orchid provides a long green fruit commonly called vanilla pod.\nGourmet and suave, Melipona is a fragrance that opens elegantly with woody and vanilla notes and gives way to oriental and amber notes in the base.",

      "detailed_description": "Here, in Cappadocia, at the heart of Türkiye, the earth retains the memory of an unblemished emotion, a shiver of saffron, sandalwood and myrrh surfaces on the skin. Impressive, ancestral formations rise up like exclamations to the sky. They are known as ‘fairy chimneys’, natural pillars of soft, friable rock shaped by volcanic eruption, the passage of time and the weathering of the elements. They watch over the mountains, craters, plateaus and gorges, over the underground and cave-dwelling cities.\nThe palette of Cappadocia is organic, carnal: white jasmine, ochre benzoin, Turkish rose, gold vanilla and tawny sandalwood. Come nightfall, a purple iris arrives and then the chimney tops secretly open, releasing the caressing perfume of flowers, resins and woods: a message to the stars. A multi-coloured hot-air balloon appears on the horizon; the passengers in its basket sail above the landscape’s varied facets, swept away by its airy, scent-filled beauty. The fragrance Cappadocia makes this a dream come true.",

Epona, a tribute to the Celtic goddess of horses, captures the essence of equine potency and pastoral tranquillity. The delicate floral touches of violet dance in ebbing sunbeams, while distinct saddle soap accord brings a vibrancy that springs forth from balmy hair. Gods and Goddesses streak luminous resin fingerprints on sun-drenched saddles; thundering hooves softened with honey. Verdant grass tumbles and sears in August’s gilded sun. Colt strands stream in summer’s soft tempest. And you breathe again, with leather, heat, meadows and skin.\nOur Perfumer's Inspiration\n\"Epona embodies the cherished memories of Liz’s bond with her beloved horse amidst the enchanting English countryside. Inspired by their intimate connection, it captures the essence of warm summer days spent amidst sweet hay fields and the gentle caress of the sun. The fragrance intertwines notes of leather, opoponax, and violet to evoke the comforting scent of a cherished saddle and the earthy aroma of a horse's coat. With a subtle hint of saddle soap accord, it reminisces the tender care lavished upon a faithful companion. Epona is a nostalgic ode to the timeless bond between horse and rider amidst nature's embrace. Liz has placed her own leather accord and distinctive horse accord against honey, vetiver, oakmoass and petitgrain for a complex and stirring capturing of horse skin, hair, leather and meadows.\"",

This sharp creation highlights a signature shiso leaf paired with yuzu to boost a skin-soft orange blossom. A fragrance as necessary as water on bare skin.\n\nRomeo's words: “Tender as maternal skin, smooth as a thin fabric.”\nPerfumer: Alexis Dadier (Robertet)\nFleur d'OH is a gender fluid orange blossom that oscillates between the radiance and softness of orange blossom, and the vibration of modern amber woods. This is a theme that is dear to me because I have always wanted to wear an orange blossom perfume that is neither feminine nor classic cologne. The yuzu and shiso leaves start creates a spark whose light extends to the bottom of this fragrance lined with moss and musks.",

Sissa exhilarates the mind with thought-provoking reminder that it is the small steps that pave the way to greatness.\n\"I was inspired to play with edible notes in a new way, less traditional sweet facets but more savory, warmed elements. Ambrette Seed leads the fragrance in warmth allowing the toasted sesame seed and coumarin heart to open and grow against the contrast of the enveloping, resinous facets of the labdanum in the finish. This fragrance feels personal and has a cocooning trail.\" - Christelle Laprade, Perfumer.",

Incense is the very pillar of my creation. A noble material, it brings unique light as well as depth and elegance to this perfume. Its contrasting scents first exude sparkling top notes, before giving way to a warm and enveloping trail.\"",

Upon first spray, the luscious sweetness of fig and the soft, powdery elegance of violet immediately envelop you, evoking a sense of warmth and contentment. As the fragrance unfolds, a lively burst of green rhubarb injects brightness, while tonka bean adds a peppery nuance that invigorates the senses. This blend of contrasts makes Fig Me Up stand out as an unforgettable, distinctive scent.\nCreated for those with bold, confident tastes, Fig Me Up goes beyond being just a fleeting scent. It’s a signature that leaves a lasting mark. At its heart, an almost hidden yet deeply sensual accord emerges, where the sweetness of candied plum blends seamlessly with the opulence of oud and sandalwood. Earthy tobacco adds a soft, comforting layer, ensuring the fragrance lingers delicately, offering a quiet yet undeniable allure throughout the day.\nFig Me Up by Mancera evolves in three uplifting stages. It begins with a fresh, invigorating rush of Mediterranean fig leaves and zesty green rhubarb, evoking the vibrancy of a sunlit morning. The heart reveals a refined whisper of French violet, adding a soothing, floral grace. As the scent deepens, creamy fig milk envelops the senses in warmth, complemented by the richness of Australian oud and sandalwood. The base is enriched by sweet Venezuelan tonka and the comforting softness of Cuban tobacco, leaving a lingering trail of gentle, lasting pleasure.\nFig Me Up by Mancera is a fragrance crafted to evoke pure joy, unfolding in three uplifting phases. It opens with a vibrant burst of Mediterranean fig leaves and zesty green rhubarb, bringing an immediate sense of freshness and vitality, like a bright morning in a sun-drenched orchard. As the scent evolves, the heart introduces the soft elegance of French violet, a floral whisper that adds a calming, delicate touch. As the fragrance deepens, creamy fig milk wraps the senses in a warm cocoon, beautifully complemented by the richness of Australian oud and sandalwood. The base lingers with the sweet and soothing notes of Venezuelan tonka and Cuban tobacco, leaving behind a comforting trail that feels like an endless smile.\nTop notes: Mediterranean fig leaves, green rhubarb, French violet\nMiddle notes: creamy fig milk, Australian oud and sandalwood, candied plum, geranium Bourbon\nBase notes: hot toffee, Venezuelan tonka beans, Cuban tobacco, white musk\nFig Me Up is availablle as 60ml and 120ml Eau de Parfum.",

Cosmic forces are important ingredients to complete the circle of the Xerjoff K Blue collection with a precise astrological perfume production calendar.\nInspired by ancient cosmologies and what is known as the “highest heaven”, Empiryan opens to earthy notes of cypriol and the warm yet sweet herbaceous notes of tobacco leaves. An experience that grounds the wearer with green, earthy notes gradually transports the senses to an ethereal state of calm and sacredness as incense and cedar are released at heart. Delicate yet compelling, Empiryan’s base of vanilla, labdanum, and amber perfectly rounds up this divine scent.\nOLFACTORY NOTES",

Our first idea was to use angelic seed essential oil, thinking it would perfectly embody the fragrance’s name. Yet, as art often dictates, it wasn’t quite right for the scent we dreamed of. That’s when we experimented with carrot seed essential oil—a less celebrated choice, the sidekick of many hero ingredients in perfumery, that doesn’t have the immediate charm of angelic seed essential oil but is rich with potential. It’s in this shift that Angélique truly began to blossom.\nPEACE Angélique is like a peaceful melody in life's constant hustle.\nThis perfume is crafted for those on a journey to embracing life's imperfections, letting go of the past, finding peace with their flaws, and choosing to rise above and soar higher.",

A contemplation of the work led to the compilation of a list with all its botanical elements and which Maria Candida then used to create her eponymous homage to the original, amalgamating seemingly disparate olfactory notes and culminating in a liminal space suspended between our ancestral past and her divergent current style.",

Each adornment is hand-crafted in the artist’s Istanbul ateliers. Meticulous artistic craftsmanship that makes each piece unique.\nThis precious rendezvous is the result of a shared inspiration drawn from the perfect beauty of nature. This year, the two Houses explore together the sublimation of bestiary. Symbol of the House since 1853, the bee is an exceptional pollinator, particularly offering the world the finest flowers that give perfumers the richest of palettes to compose extraordinary fragrances. The iconic Bee Bottle is adorned in an imperial bee set at the heart of a voluptuous and sparkling flower.\n“I choose the bee because the iconic animal of Guerlain, the real queen, is the bee.”\nBEGÜM KHAN\nThis limited and numbered edition of 4,515 pieces of 125mL is presented with a 30mL travel spray and a funnel to pour the fragrance into the spray.",

      "detailed_description": "Fashion designer Gabriela Hearst teamed up with Fueguia's founder and perfumer to launch two fragrances called New York and Paysandú. Paysandou and New York each have their own aromatic signatures, shaped and inspired by Gabriela Hirst's two geographical regions and stages of life. They were created to be read individually and as a progression.\n\"Working with Julian on this project of 2 years has been thrilling. It combines my life so far, half with my roots in Paysandú and half in New York. Childhood memories and landscapes (for Paysandú) and the strength of womanhood (for New York) are combined with the alchemy of science and the pheromone potion that Julian crafted. Julian is hungry for knowledge.\" - Gabriela Hearst.\n\"New York draws its inspiration from the movement from South to North, weaving floral and notas dulces with typical North American woods. It’s a smokier, heavier, and more aged version of the spirit of the rural and herbal Paysandú.\nBased on the research of two Nobel prizes, Leopold Ruzicka – who during the mid-1920’s studied the molecular structure of musk— and Linda B. Buck – awarded in 2004 alongside Richard Axel, for their discoveries in scent as a code and a subtle form of communication through volatile molecules— Julian Bedel developed this idea of musk as a language, an amplifier of one’s scent. This compound of pheromone messengers helps volatilize the aroma of skin. As a result, each individual’s aromatic identity gets amplified and gives a distinctive character to each perfume. Ultimately, each person will have a different version of the scent. An exclusive formula of Fueguia’s musk of plant origin was developed both for Paysandú and New York.\nTrue to Fueguia’s mission of botanical research and scientific innovation, the ingredients that compose Paysandú were produced in Fueguia Botany in Manantiales, Uruguay. Marcela and Carqueja, ingredients that had never been used in perfumery, were extracted through Super Critical CO2 at Fueguia’s unique high-end facilities and are what gives a significant part of the unique character of the scent. Marcela, traditionally used by the Charrúas people as a medicinal plant, is still a symbol of this cultural heritage in Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina.\"\nString\nTonic: Balsam Fir\nMain Note: Tobacco\nSub-vocal: Jacaranda wood\nMelody\nMaple Resin, Virginia Cedar, Vanilla, Rose Original, Cherry Blossom, Black Pepper, Palo Santo, Patchouli, Tonka Bean, Nutmeg\nAvailable as a 100ml Perfume.",

Kemi straddles the line between the tangible and the intangible, the earthly and the ethereal, the real and the magical.\nAqua Regia evokes all that is noble in the alchemic world. Conjuring up the dazzle of gold and the resilience of platinum, it casts a powerful spell over everything it touches.

This initial freshness evolves into a rich medley of peach, pear, and blackcurrant notes. The scent's foundation is a luxurious mix of cashmere wood and ambroxan, enriched with smooth vanilla and caramel for a cozy, gentle conclusion. The fragrance achieves a harmonious balance, offering a surprising yet cohesive aromatic experience.\nTop notes: blackcurrant, pear, peach\nMiddle notes: jasmine, orange blossom, patchouli\nBase notes: ambroxan, vanilla, cashmere wood, caramel\nThe fragrance's vessel retains the iconic, timeless architecture of the original Karl Lagerfeld Pour Femme Eau de Parfum bottle: a sleek glass structure topped with a clear lid, accented by a spiked metal ring. The bottle undergoes a striking transformation with the addition of a mesmerizing red hue, adorned with the renowned Karl Lagerfeld emblem and the \"rouge\" inscription in a contemporary, graffiti-inspired typeface.\nAvailable as 45ml and 85ml Eau de Parfum.",

      "detailed_description": "For this formula, I had fun doing my job as an illusionist, building a jasmine accord from scratch, then dressing it up with spices and accentuating the celery facet of the cis-jamone. Like curry and immortelle, celery essence reminds me of the warm, sensual scent of skin. And at certain times of the day, jasmine exudes animalic, even visceral facets that are heady and intoxicating. I wanted to highlight these, as well as the tobacco and cold, slightly metallic ashes of jasmine Grandiflorum. I created a jasmine hybrid that has the fruity, animalic aspects of Sambac and the green, tobacco-like qualities of Grandiflorum. The accord is soft ened and warmed by Peruvian balsam supported by green vanilla. Cardamom adds a fresh, creamy top note. Osmanthus flower provides natural support for the leathery and stable notes of paracresol, while adding the velvety smoothness of apricot skin.",

In the sky of this red desert, it is common to observe lights and strange shapes moving quickly in space. A specific area of this desert has been used to listen to the \"sounds of the universe\" through numerous receptive phono dishes, the purpose of which is to go in search of the primordial sound of the bigbang, or perhaps, who knows what other unknown mysteries.",

      "detailed_description": "Shihab, the latest addition to Spirit of Kings' Gold Collection, takes its name from the Arabic word for \"shooting star,\" symbolizing the fleeting beauty and wonder of this celestial phenomenon. This fragrance embodies the serene elegance of a summer evening in a royal garden, where the air is filled with the intoxicating aroma of ripe fruits as the day gently fades into night.\nThe composition begins with a bright, invigorating blend of raspberries, pink pepper, peach, apple, and bergamot, creating an uplifting and vibrant introduction. As the scent evolves, the heart unveils an opulent mix of Turkish rose, jasmine, patchouli, and cedarwood, adding depth and floral sophistication. The fragrance concludes with warm, sensual base notes of sandalwood, musk, amber, tonka, and vanilla, leaving a long-lasting, comforting impression reminiscent of a golden summer sunset.\nIn the heart of a majestic kingdom, as the king strolls through his lavish garden at twilight, the sweet scent of ripening raspberries fills the air. In this tranquil moment, he gazes upon the sky and witnesses the magic of a shooting star—Shihab—gracing the evening horizon. Though brief, the moment is one of peace and wonder, forever etched in his memory.\nShihab encapsulates this enchanting experience through its intricate blend of fruity and floral notes. The lush raspberry opening is elevated by a hint of pink pepper's spice, while the floral heart of Turkish rose and jasmine evokes the refined beauty of a twilight garden. The warmth of amber, musk, and patchouli in the base lingers like the fading light of a summer day, creating a fragrance that is both timeless and regal.\nThe vibrant hue of orange, symbolizing creativity, joy, and energy, is an ideal reflection of Shihab’s essence. Evoking the warmth of a sunset and the sweetness of ripe raspberries, orange captures the scent’s youthful and refreshing character. The fragrance is further adorned with an orange sapphire, a gemstone representing happiness, love, and wisdom. This radiant jewel adds a touch of luxury and vibrance, mirroring the playful yet majestic qualities of Shihab.\nMore than just a perfume, Shihab is a sensory journey through the splendor of a summer evening, captured in a fleeting yet unforgettable moment beneath a shooting star. Ideal for those seeking a harmonious blend of freshness, floral grace, and lasting warmth, Shihab is a celebration of nature’s transient beauty and timeless allure.",

      "detailed_description": "Crema Limone is a gourmand citrus fragrance that tells stories of sweetness and freshness. An olfactory cuddle that envelops you thanks to its soft and creamy notes that bring back old childhood memories. Lemon and orange zest evoke an explosion of freshness, enriched by the softness of vanilla and almond milk. The delicious notes of brown sugar and caramel leave an indelible memory on the skin.\nWhen telling the stories of a place we come across distant flavors that our grandparents tell. So it was with that charming dessert that once accompanied the \"Special Coffee\" in Polignano, a delicacy of the village since 1920. An extraordinary ice cream, a delight for adults and children, made by enriching the flavor of the cream with delicate Polignano a Mare lemons.",

      "detailed_description": "Uxalpha, another wonder from the Luna collection, came to life on a May night when the pristine skies of Paolo and Tiziana’s hills revealed the secret of a shining star to them. The Alpha star in the Lynx constellation, the brightest in its celestial realm, shone with the energy of 700 suns, illuminating the darkness with a vibrant, infectious light. This enchanted experience provided the inspiration to create a fragrance that celebrates the vitality and radiance of souls that never cease to shine. Uxalpha is an ode to power and brilliance, dedicated to those who radiate light and vitality at all times. This essence captures the power of the Alpha star, taking the wearer on an olfactory journey that explores the energy and luminosity of the Lynx constellation. ThLikeits companion Ixbeta, the uniqueness of Uxalpha lies in its ability to blend with other fragrances in the constellation to create unique, inimitable combinations. When exploring the Lynx constellation, you will have the opportunity to discover the art of intergalactic layering, enjoying the astral fusion of the fragrances it inspired: Lince, Uxalpha, Ixbeta and Lincys. The top notes of Uxalpha open with a fresh explosion of Calabrian Bergamot, Sicilian Orange and Pink Grapefruit. This symphony of citrus fruits ignites the senses with its sparkling vivacity. At the heart of the fragrance, Cuban Cedarwood introduces a warm, enveloping woody note, while Mexican Coconut and Musk add an exotic sweetness. Italian Labdanum completes the heart with its resinous depth, evoking the magic of a tropical night under a starry sky. The base notes of Uxalpha offer a rich, complex foundation: Ambergris lends a warm, mysterious richness, while Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and Turkish Caramel add a velvety, inviting sweetness. Indian Red Patchouli completes the blend with an earthy,intense note, creating an olfactory symphony that glows with warmth and passion. Uxalpha is an ode to light and inner vitality, a journey of the senses that celebrates the ability to radiate strength and beauty around the world.\n\nTop Notes:\nCalabrian Bergamot, Sicilian Orange & Pink Grapefruit\nHeart Notes:\nCuban Cedarwood, Mexican Coconut, Musk & Italian Labdanum\nBase Notes:\nAmbergris, Madagascar Vanilla Bourbon, Turkish Caramel & Red Indian Patchouli",

You pause to gaze at your reflection in the elaborate gold mirror in the entrance and touch up your deep burgundy lipstick before removing your suede jacket and taking a seat in the booth with your friends. You take a sip of cabernet, and a trace of your lipstick stains the rim of the glass – leaving a lasting impression.\nThe Fragrance: Sweet notes of sparkling orange, juicy green apple, and saffron soften into mid notes of raspberry nectar, jasmine petals, lily of the valley, and damask rose.

      "detailed_description": "\"Containing nearly 50 ingredients, PURPLE POWDER is Daniel Gallagher’s most ambitious formula yet. He wanted to create a fragrance with many different layers, a concept which seems to be far removed from the relatively simplistic mainstream singular-enduring-note releases we experience in vast quantities today. Nothing against simplistic fragrances – with Daniel owning several – but he wanted to create a fragrance which takes you on a much longer olfactory journey. Daniel finds that he wears his most complex fragrances in the Fall and Winter when days are cool and nights are cooler, which motivated him to challenge his nose and create something for the true niche fragrance lover.\n\"PURPLE POWDER combines a melange of citruses, warm and cool spices, an enduring powderiness, woody, resinous, balsamic depth, and five different musks. A Gallagher Fragrance would not be complete without Patchouli, with PURPLE POWDER featuring a Patchouli Heart ingredient from IFF-LMR. PURPLE POWDER also features a helping of another Gallagher favorite: Madagascar Vanilla Absolute. So, grab your favorite cool-weather beverage and join Gallagher Fragrances on a journey into PURPLE POWDER.\" (info from the brand)",

A reimagination of the classic notes of the original fragrance collection, perfumers Frank Voelkl and Nathalie Lorson customized a blend of compelling ingredients while still highlighting the hero orchid note of the Euphoria fragrance collection. The new composition opens with juicy blackcurrant essence. At the heart, the feminine orchid flambé accord is contrasted by smoky black sesame for a sophisticated and fiery floral center. To round out the base, an exclusive blend of oud, bamboo and sandalwood creates a mysterious woody facet. The rich warmth of these notes, alongside a lasting trail of tuberose, creates an unforgettable fragrance that channels feelings of confidence and empowerment.\"\nCalvin Klein My Euphoria is available in 10, 30, 50, and 100 ml Eau de Parfum.",

A transparency evincing that there is nothing to hide yet everything to discover. The studded cap made of glass echoes Maison Valentino’s signature emblem, the stud, a square and cruciform shape that pays homage to Rome and to the \"bugnato\" found on the Roman Palazzos. A recognizable insignia that has expressed the Maison’s identity over time.\nThe flacon is completed by a golden champagne spray button and the engraved VLogo. Echoing the fabric of Haute Couture boxes, each fragrance finds its name on the canvas fabric. A dimensional stud reflects each juice’s color at the base of the bottle.",
